<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="beg">The</span> narratives in this volume, which is a companion
to my <i>Soldiers’ Stories of the War</i>, are told on exactly
the same lines as those which were adopted for that
collection. There was a personal interview to get the
teller’s own tale; then the writing, the object being to
act as the soldier’s other self; and finally the submission
to him of the typescript, so that he could revise
and become responsible for the completed work.</p>

<p>In dealing with these records I have tried to be a
faithful interpreter or reproducer of a tale that has
been told to me. I have invited a man to tell his story
as it came into his mind, and to look upon me simply
as a means of putting it into concrete and coherent
form, and as a medium between himself and the reader.
The greatest difficulty that had to be overcome was
a narrator’s reluctance to speak of his own achievements,
though he never failed to wax enthusiastic
when telling of the doings of his comrades. Nothing
has left a deeper impression on my mind than the
generous praise which a gunner, say, has bestowed
upon the infantry, and the blessings that the infantry
have invoked upon the gunners. Never in any of
Great Britain’s wars has there been such an exhibition
of universal esprit de corps as we have witnessed in this
stupendous conflict between civilisation and freedom
and cultured barbarism and tyranny.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more encouraging to me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
compiler and editor of these true tales than the generous
praise that was given to the companion volume. I
am grateful to all my critics, who, without exception,
so far as I know, welcomed and accepted the work for
what it professed to be&mdash;an honest contribution on
behalf of soldiers to the history of the war.</p>

<p>I set out to do a certain thing&mdash;to act as pilot to
members of a wondrous band who found themselves
in unknown waters, and I succeeded past my utmost
expectations. I am proud to think that any act of
mine has put on record the doings of patriotic men who
have fought so nobly for their country; and thankful
to feel that I have been the means of getting for his
relatives and friends and all the rest of us the experiences
of more than one fine fellow who since I saw him
has answered the roll-call for the last time.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">IN THE LINE OF BATTLE</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pcn">HOW TROOPER POTTS WON THE V.C. ON BURNT HILL</p>

<p class="pch">[As part of the operations in Gallipoli, it was decided to
bombard and attack a very strongly fortified Turkish position
near Suvla Bay&mdash;a sector stretching from Hill 70 to Hill 112.
The frontal attack was a desperate enterprise, as the Turks
had dug themselves in up to the neck in two lines of trenches
of exceptional strength. The attack was made on the afternoon
of August 21st, 1915, after a bombardment by battleships
and heavy land batteries. It was in the course of this
advance that the teller of this story, Trooper Frederick William
Owen Potts, of the 1/1st Berkshire Yeomanry (Territorial
Force), was struck down, and later performed the unparalleled
act for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. For
nearly fifty hours Trooper Potts remained under the Turkish
trenches with a severely wounded and helpless comrade,
“although he could himself have returned to safety,” says
the official record. Finally the trooper, in the extraordinary
manner which he now describes, saved his comrade’s life.
Trooper Potts is only twenty-two years old, and is the first
Yeoman to win the most coveted of all distinctions.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I saw</span> a good deal of the Turks before we came to
grips with them near Suvla Bay. I had gone out to
Egypt with my regiment, the Berkshire Yeomanry,
and for about four months we were doing garrison work
and escort work for Turks who had been captured in
Gallipoli and the Dardanelles and sent as prisoners of
war to Egypt. Our place was not far from Cairo. I
was greatly struck by the size and physique of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Turks. There were some very fine big men amongst
them&mdash;in fact, I should think the average height was
close on six feet.</p>

<p>We had taken our horses out to Egypt with us,
and all our work in that country was done with them;
but as the weeks went by, and no call came to us for
active service, we became disappointed, and got into
the way of singing a song which the poet of the regiment
had specially composed, and of which the finish
of every verse was the line&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“The men that nobody wants,”</p>

<p class="pn1">this meaning that there was no use for us as cavalry
in the fighting area. But when the four months had
gone, the order suddenly came for us to go to Gallipoli.
By that time we had got acclimatised, a point we
appreciated later, as the heat was intense and the flies
were very troublesome.</p>

<p>From Alexandria we sailed in a transport, which
occupied four days in reaching Gallipoli. Here we
were transhipped to trawlers and barges, and immediately
found ourselves in the thick of one of the most
tremendous bombardments the world has ever known.
Battleships were firing their big guns, which made a
terrific noise, and there was other continual firing of
every known sort. We were very lucky in our landing,
because we escaped some of the heaviest of the gun-fire.
The Turks could see us, though we had no sight of
them, and whenever a cluster of us was spotted, a
shell came crashing over. Thus we had our baptism
of fire at the very start.</p>

<p>We were in an extraordinarily difficult country, and
whatever we needed in the way of food and drink we
had to carry with us&mdash;even the water. Immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
numbers of tins had been filled from the Nile and taken
to Gallipoli in barges, and this was the water we used
for drinking purposes, as well as water which was condensed
from the sea, and kept in big tanks on the shore.
Every drop of water we needed had to be fetched from
the shore, and this work proved about the hardest
and most dangerous of any we had to do after landing
and taking up our position on a hill. Several of our
chaps were knocked over in this water-fetching work.</p>

<p>While we were at this place we were employed in
making roads from Suvla Bay to Anzac, and hard work
it was, because the country was all rocks. We had
landed light, without blankets or waterproofs, so that
we felt the intense cold of the nights very much.</p>

<p>We had a week of this sort of thing, under fire all the
time. I think it was on a Sunday we landed, and a
week later we heard that we were to take part in the
attack on Hill 70, or, as we called it, because of its
appearance, Burnt Hill. There were immense quantities
of a horrible sort of scrub on it, and a great deal
of this stuff had been fired and charred by gun-fire.
I little knew then how close and long an acquaintance
I was to make with the scrub on Hill 70.</p>

<p>It was about five o’clock in the evening when the
great news came. We were to be ready at seven, and
ready we were, glad to be in it. We did not know
much, but we understood that we were to take our
places in some reserve trenches. Night comes
quickly in those regions, and when the day had gone
we moved round to Anzac, marching along the roads
which we had partially made. We reached Anzac
at about two o’clock in the morning, in pitch darkness.</p>

<p>We had a pick and two shovels to four men, and
took it in turn to carry them. Each man also carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
two hundred rounds of ammunition, so that we were
pretty well laden. When we reached Anzac Cove
we moved in right under the cliffs, which go sheer
down to the sea; but there is practically no tide, so
that the beach is safe. The only way to reach the
shore was to go in single file down a narrow, twisting
pathway.</p>

<p>We were on the beach till about two o’clock in the
afternoon, when we were ordered to be ready with
our packs, and we went up the cliff, again in single
file, forming up when we reached the top. Then we
went a mile or so along the road we had marched over
the night before&mdash;all part of the scheme of operations,
I take it. Then we cut across to our right and saw
a plain called Salt Lake, where we watched a division
going into action under heavy shrapnel fire.</p>

<p>We were now in the thick of the awful country
which I was to know so well. The surface was all
sand and shrubs, and the great peculiarity of the
shrubs was that they were very much like our holly
trees at home, though the leaves were not so big, but
far more prickly. These shrubs were about three
feet high, and they were everywhere; but they did
not provide any real cover. There were also immense
numbers of long creepers and grass, and a lot of dust
and dirt. The heat was fearful, so that you can
easily understand how hard it was to get along when
we were on the move. These obstacles proved
disastrous to many of our chaps when they got into
the zone of fire, for the shrapnel set the shrubs ablaze.
This meant that many a brave fellow who was hit
during the fighting on Hill 70 fell among the burning
furze and was burned to death where he lay.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="f4" id="f4">f4</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="pc">CHOCOLATE HILL.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>As we were waiting for our turn, we could see the
other chaps picking their way through this burning
stuff, and charging on towards the Turkish trenches.
When our own turn came, the scrub was burning less
fiercely, and to some extent we were able to choose
our way and avoid the blazing patches. We ran
whenever we got the chance, making short rushes;
but when we got into the real zone of fire, we
never stopped until we were under the protection of
Chocolate Hill.</p>

<p>For half an hour we rested at the foot of this hill.
From our position we could not see the Turks, who
were entrenched over the top; but their snipers were
out and bothering us a good deal. It was impossible
to see these snipers, because they hid themselves most
cunningly in the bushes, and had their faces and rifles
painted the same colour as the surrounding objects.
However, we levelled up matters by sending out our
own sniping parties.</p>

<p>We were on the move again as soon as we had got
our breath back. We still understood, as we moved
to the left of Chocolate Hill, that we were going to
occupy reserve trenches. We went through a field
of ripe wheat. About two yards in front of me was
a mate of mine, Reginald West. I saw him struck in
the thigh by a sniper’s bullet, which went in as big
as a pea, and came out the size of a five-shilling piece.
It was an explosive bullet, one of many that were
used against us by the Turks, under their German
masters. In a sense West was lucky, because when
he was struck down he fell right on the edge of a
dug-out, and I heard one of the men shout, “Roll
over, mate! Roll over! You’ll drop right in here!”
And he did.</p>

<p>The rest of us went on, though in the advance we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
lost a number of men. Some were killed outright;
some were killed by shells and bullets after they had
fallen wounded, and some had to lie where they had
fallen and do the best they could. We pushed ahead
till we struck Hill 70 again.</p>

<p>When we got to the reserve trenches I asked a chap
how far away the Turks were, and he answered,
“About a thousand yards,” but I don’t think it was
as much as that.</p>

<p>Now we began to ascend Hill 70 in short spurts,
halting from time to time. We had fairly good
cover, because the scrub was not on fire, though
several parts had been burnt out. During one of
these halts we were ordered to fix bayonets.</p>

<p>We had found shelter in a bit of a gulley, and were
pretty well mixed up with other regiments&mdash;the
Borders, Dorsets, and so on. We first got the idea
that we were going to charge from an officer near us;
but he was knocked out&mdash;with a broken arm, I
believe&mdash;before the charge came off. He was just
giving us the wheeze about the coming charge when
a bullet struck him.</p>

<p>How did the charge begin? Well, an officer
shouted, as far as I can recollect, “Come on, lads!
We’ll give ‘em beans!” That is not exactly according
to drill-books and regulations as I know them;
but it was enough. It let the boys loose, and they
simply leapt forward and went for the Turkish
trenches. It was not to be my good fortune to get
into them, however; in fact, I did not get very far
after the order to charge was given.</p>

<p>I had gone perhaps twenty or thirty yards when I
was knocked off my feet. I knew I was hit. I had
a sort of burning sensation; but whether I was hit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the act of jumping, or whether I jumped because I
was hit, I do not know. What I <i>do</i> know is that I
went up in the air, came down again, and lay where
I fell. I knew that I had been shot at the top of the
left thigh, the bullet going clean through and just
missing the artery and the groin by an eighth of an
inch, as the doctor told me later.</p>

<p>Utterly helpless, I lay there for about three-quarters
of an hour, while the boys rushed round me
and scattered in the charge. This happened about
a quarter of a mile from the top of the hill. I
propped myself up on my arm and watched the boys
charging.</p>

<p>I heard later, from a man who was with me in
hospital at Malta&mdash;he had been struck deaf and dumb,
for the time being, amongst other things&mdash;that the
boys got into the Turkish third trench and that the
Turks bolted. He told me that when they reached
this third trench there were only seventeen Berkshire
boys left to hold it. The enemy seemed to get wind
of this; then it looked as if all the Turkish army was
going for the seventeen, and they had no alternative
but to clear out.</p>

<p>After the charge I saw this handful come back
down the hill, quite close to where I was lying. I
had fallen in a sort of little thicket, a cluster of the
awful scrub which was like holly, but much worse.
I was thankful for it, however, because it gave me a
bit of shelter and hid me from view.</p>

<p>I had been lying there about half an hour when I
heard a noise near me and saw that a poor wounded
chap, a trooper of the Berkshires, was crawling towards
me. I recognised him as a fellow-townsman.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Andrews?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>He simply answered “Yes.” That was all he
could get out.</p>

<p>“I’m jolly pleased you’ve come,” I said, and
Andrews crawled as close as he could get, and we lay
there, perfectly still, for about ten minutes. Andrews
had been shot through the groin, a very dangerous
wound, and he was suffering terribly and losing a
great deal of blood.</p>

<p>We had been together for a few minutes when
another trooper&mdash;a stranger to me&mdash;crawled up to
our hiding-place. He had a wound in the leg. We
were so cramped for space under the thicket, that
Andrews had to shift as best he could, to make room
for the newcomer. That simple act of mercy saved
his life, for the stranger had not been with us more
than ten minutes when a bullet went through both
his legs and mortally wounded him. He kept on
crying for water; but we had not a drop amongst
the three of us, and could not do anything to quench
his awful thirst.</p>

<p>That fearful afternoon passed slowly, with its
grizzling heat and constant fighting, and the night
came quickly. The night hours brought us neither
comfort nor security, for a full moon shone, making
the countryside as light as day. The cold was
intense. The stranger was practically unconscious
and kept moving about, which made our position
worse, because every time he moved the Turks
banged at us.</p>

<p>I was lying absolutely as flat as I could, with my
face buried in the dirt, for the bullets were peppering
the ground all around us, and one of them actually
grazed my left ear&mdash;you can see the scar it has made,
just over the top. This wound covered my face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
blood. Was I scared or frightened? I can honestly
say that I was not. I had got beyond that stage, and
almost as a matter of course I calmly noted the details
of everything that happened.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of that unspeakable night
this poor Bucks Hussar chap hung on. He kept
muttering, “Water! Water!” But we could not
give him any. When the end came he simply lay
down and died right away, and his dead body stayed
with us, for we could neither get away nor move
him.</p>

<p>During the whole of the next day we lay in our
hiding-place, suffering indescribably. The sun, thirst,
hunger, and our wounds, all added to our pain. In
our desperation we picked bits off the stalks of the
shrubs and tried to suck them; but we got no relief
in that way.</p>

<p>The whole of the day went somehow&mdash;with such
slowness that it seemed as if it would never end. It
was impossible to sleep&mdash;fighting was going on all
the time, and the noise was terrific. We could not
see anything of our boys, and we knew that it was
impossible for any stretcher-bearers to get through
to us, because we were a long way up the hill and no
stretcher-bearers could venture out under such a
terrible fire.</p>

<p>Night came again at last, and Andrews and myself
decided to shift, if it was humanly possible to do so,
because it was certain death from thirst and hunger to
remain where we were, even if we escaped from bullets.
So I began to move away by crawling, and Andrews
followed as best he could. I would crawl a little way
and wait till Andrews, poor fellow, could crawl up
to me again. We wriggled like snakes, absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
flat on the ground and with our faces buried in the
stifling dirt.</p>

<p>We managed to wriggle about three hundred yards
that night&mdash;as near as I can judge. Starting at
about a quarter past six, as soon as the day was done,
it was about three in the morning when we decided
to rest, so that if we had really done three hundred
yards we had crawled at the rate of only thirty-three
yards an hour!</p>

<p>A great number of rifles were lying about&mdash;weapons
which had been cast aside in the charge, or had belonged
to fallen soldiers; but most of them were
quite out of working order, because they were clogged
up with dust and dirt. I tried many of them, and
at last found one that seemed to be in good working
order, and to my joy I came across about fifty rounds
of ammunition. Another serviceable rifle was found,
so that Andrews and myself were filled with a new
hope.</p>

<p>“We’ll die like Britons, at any rate!” said Andrews.
“We’ll give a good account of ourselves before we
go!” And I agreed with him.</p>

<p>We were now some distance from the Turks, and
I was terribly anxious to shoot at them; but Andrews
was more cautious. “If you fire they’ll discover us,
and we shall be done for!” he said. Then we shook
hands fervently, because we both believed that this
was the last of us, and I know that in thought we
both went back to our very early days and offered
up our silent prayers to God.</p>

<p>We had managed to crawl to a bit of shelter which
was given by some burnt-out scrub, and here we tried
to snatch some sleep, for we were both worn out.
We went to sleep, for the simple reason that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
could not keep awake; but I suddenly awoke, because
the cold was intense and I was nearly frozen. Luckily
there were a lot of empty sandbags lying about, and
I got two or three of these and put them on top of us;
but they were really no protection from the bitter air.</p>

<p>When the morning came we made a move, and for
the first time we were able to get some water; but
only by taking the water-bottles from the poor chaps
who had been knocked out.</p>

<p>Then we crept back to our shelter, finding immense
relief from drinking the water we had got, though it
was quite warm and was, I fancy, from the Nile.</p>

<p>We slept, or tried to sleep, there for the rest of that
night, and stayed in the place till next morning. We
must have been in what is called “dead ground,”
a region which cannot be seen or touched by either
side, and so it proved to be, for in the early morning
there was a real battle and the bullets were singing
right over our heads.</p>

<p>“There’s more lead flying about than there was
yesterday,” said Andrews; and really some of the
bullets were splashing quite close to us&mdash;within six
feet, I think, though there were not many that came
so near.</p>

<p>Andrews was bleeding terribly&mdash;every time he
moved he bled; but I did the best I could for him with
my iodine&mdash;I dressed him with mine, and he dressed
me with his, and splendid stuff it is. Though we
had nothing to eat we did not really feel hungry now&mdash;we
were past the eating stage. I was very lucky in
having four cigarettes and some matches and I risked
a smoke, the sweetest I ever had in my life.</p>

<p>Again we stuck the awful day through.</p>

<p>I was terribly anxious to move and get out of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
all at any cost; but still Andrews was very cautious.
“No, we won’t try till it gets dark,” he said. I felt
that he was right, and so we waited, as patiently as
we could, for the night. Three or four yards from us
was an inviting-looking bush, and we crawled towards
it, thinking it would help us to get away and give us
shelter; but at the end of our adventure we discovered
that we had done no more than crawl to the bush,
crawl round it, and get back to our original hiding-place;
so we decided to give up the attempt to get
away just then.</p>

<p>When the third night on the hill came we were
fairly desperate, knowing that something would have
to be done if we meant to live, and that certain death
awaited us where we were. We had nothing to eat,
and the only drink was the water, which was frightful
stuff&mdash;I believe it was Nile water which had been
brought. But though it was, we were thankful to
have it. The water was warm, because of the heat,
and was about the colour of wine.</p>

<p>We did not for a moment suppose that we
should live to reach the British lines, which we
believed to be not far away; but we risked
everything on the effort, and in the moonlight we
began to wriggle off. We had managed to get no
more than half a dozen yards when Andrews had to
give it up. I myself, though I was the stronger and
better of the two, could scarcely crawl. Every
movement was a torture and a misery, because of
the thorns that stuck into us from the horrible
scrub.</p>

<p>We had kept the sandbags, and with my help
Andrews managed to get them over his arms and up
to his shoulders. I fastened them with the pieces
of string they have, and these gave him a good deal
of protection, though the thorns got through and
punished us cruelly. I was picking them out of my
hands for three weeks afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Having crawled these half-dozen yards, we gave
up the attempt altogether, and did not know what to
do. We could see a cluster of trees not far away,
about a hundred yards, and there was one that looked
fairly tall.</p>

<p>“If we can get to that tree,” said Andrews, “I
could lie there, if I had some water, and perhaps
you could strike some of our chaps and bring help.”
I had little hope from such an effort as that. Then
Andrews unselfishly urged me to look after myself;
but, of course, I would not dream of leaving him. I
offered to carry him, and I tried, but I was far too
weak.</p>

<p>What in the world was to be done? How were
we to get out of this deadly place? There seemed
no earthly hope of escape, when, literally like an
inspiration, we thought we saw a way out.</p>

<p>Just near us was an ordinary entrenching shovel,
which had been dropped, or had belonged to some
poor chap who had fallen&mdash;I can’t say which, but
there it was. I crawled up and got hold of it, and
before we quite knew what was happening, Andrews
was resting on it, and I was doing my best to drag
him out of danger.</p>

<p>I cannot say whose idea this was, but it is quite
likely that Andrews thought of it first. He sat on
the shovel as best he could&mdash;he was not fastened to
it&mdash;with his legs crossed, the wounded leg over the
sound one, and he put his hands back and clasped
my wrists as I sat on the ground behind and hauled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
away at the handle. Several times he came off, or
the shovel fetched away, and I soon saw that it would
be impossible to get him away in this fashion.</p>

<p>When we began to move the Turks opened fire
on us; but I hardly cared now about the risk of being
shot, and for the first time since I had been wounded
I stood up and dragged desperately at the shovel,
with Andrews on it. I managed to get over half a
dozen yards, then I was forced to lie down and rest.
Andrews needed a rest just as badly as I did, for he
was utterly shaken and suffered greatly.</p>

<p>We started again at about a quarter past six, as
soon as the night came, and for more than three
mortal hours we made this strange journey down the
hillside; and at last, with real thankfulness, we
reached the bottom and came to a bit of a wood.
Sweet beyond expression it was to feel that I could
walk upright, and that I was near the British lines.
This knowledge came to me suddenly when there
rang through the night the command: “Halt!”</p>

<p>I obeyed&mdash;glorious it was to hear that challenge in
my native tongue, after what we had gone through.
Then this good English sentry said, “Come up and
be recognised!” not quite according to the regulation
challenge, but good enough&mdash;and he had seen
us quite clearly in the moonshine.</p>

<p>Up I went, and found myself face to face with the
sentry, whose rifle was presented ready for use, and
whose bayonet gleamed in the cold light.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” said the sentry. “Are
you burying the dead?”</p>

<p>I saw that he was sentry over a trench, and I went
to the top of it and leaned over the parapet and said,
“Can you give me a hand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s up?” said the sentry, who did not seem
to realise what had actually happened&mdash;and how
could he, in such a strange affair?</p>

<p>“I’ve got a chap out here wounded,” I told him,
“and I’ve dragged him down the hill on a shovel.”</p>

<p>The sentry seemed to understand like a flash. He
walked up to the trench, and when I had made myself
clear, three or four chaps bustled round and got a
blanket, and I led them to the spot where I had left
Andrews lying on the ground. We lifted him off
the shovel, put him on the blanket, and carried him
to the trench. These men were, I think, Inniskilling
Fusiliers, and they did everything for us that human
kindness could suggest. They gave me some rum
and bully beef and biscuit, and it was about the most
delightful meal I ever had in my life, because I was
famishing and I was safe, with Andrews, after those
dreadful hours on the hillside, which seemed as if
they would never end.</p>

<p>When we had rested and pulled round a bit, we
were put on stretchers and carried to the nearest
dressing-station. Afterwards we were sent to Malta,
where Andrews is, I believe, still in hospital.</p>

<p>The granting of the Victoria Cross for what I had
done came as a complete surprise to me, because it
never struck me that I had done more than any
other British soldier would have done for a comrade.</p>

<p>I never lost heart during the time I was lying on
Hill 70. All the old things came clearly up in my
mind, and many an old prayer was uttered, Andrews
joining in. We never lost hope that some way out
of our peril would be found&mdash;and it seemed as if our
prayers had been answered by giving us this inspiration
of the shovel.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pcn">A PRISONER OF WAR IN GERMANY</p>

<p class="pch">[For nine weary months, including the whole of an uncommonly
bitter winter, the teller of this story, Corporal
Oliver H. Blaze, 1st Battalion Scots Guards, was a prisoner
of war in Germany. Corporal Blaze was on outpost when he
was severely wounded and captured, and his subsequent experiences
give proof that in this momentous struggle we are
fighting a people who are incapable of understanding the laws
of honourable combat, and who, in the interests of humanity
and civilisation, must be crushed. Corporal Blaze is a fine
type of the splendid Guardsmen who have done so much in
this great war to add to their own glory and the noble reputation
of the British Army.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I hardly</span> know where to begin my story, but perhaps
I might start with a little tale of an air fight, because
a night or two ago I happened to be in the streets
when German airships raided London, and I could not
help recalling the difficulty of hitting even a huge
object like a Zeppelin in the night-time.</p>

<p>In the early days of September 1914, when we had
got used to fighting, the battalion was on the march
when a German aeroplane, decorated with two Iron
Crosses, was sighted. At that time we were more
than a thousand strong, and the lot of us opened fire
with our rifles, rattling away with rapid fire, so that
we soon accounted for about fifteen thousand rounds.
At the same time another battalion not far away was
on the job, so that a perfect fusillade was going on.
The firing was tremendous, but it seemed as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
machine would not be touched. At last, however,
the aeroplane was brought down, the observer being
dead and the other man severely burnt and wounded.
I do not know whether it was our battalion or the
other which got the machine; but I called to mind
the great difficulty of hitting an aircraft when I
watched the raid on London. I was walking along,
too pleasantly occupied to be thinking of war, and
did not know of the affair until I reached a street
corner and saw the people craning their necks skywards,
watching the airship and the shells that were
bursting under it.</p>

<p>Mons, Cambrai, the Marne and the like make an old,
old story by this time, so I will get on to the tale of
my nine months’ captivity in Germany, as a prisoner
of war.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge now that the Germans
never lost a chance of trying to do something by
treachery and trickery and not playing the game.
Killed and wounded English soldiers were robbed of
their coats by the Germans, who took them for their
own use; and dressed in these coats the enemy on
several occasions tried to get near us, to their heavy
cost, when we got accustomed to the dodge.</p>

<p>One day, early in September, not long after we
had gone out with the Expeditionary Force, a German
machine-gun brigade came along, dressed in our
uniform. We thought they were reinforcements, so
we let them get very close and they occupied a ridge
on our left. Ten minutes afterwards they opened
fire on us; but our garrison artillery soon shifted
them with sixty-pounders. The Germans killed a lot
of the Coldstreams that day by this trick.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that we had one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
experiences which have been so often known in this
great war. We were marching along in brigade
column, with the Black Watch or Coldstreams, I am
not sure which, leading. We were going through an
area which had been reported all clear, and had got
to a bend in the road, when the Germans started shelling
us. It was one of those swift happenings which
cannot be avoided in such a war as this, and before
we fully realised what was taking place, a shell had
burst and killed four stretcher-bearers of the Coldstreams,
the N.C.O. who was in charge, and a wounded
man who was being carried on a stretcher; and the
same shell wounded a man in our front section of
fours. That one shell did a fair lot of havoc, and
it was quickly followed by several more; but these
did not do much mischief.</p>

<p>What struck me most in this little affair was the
coolness of our C.O., Colonel Lowther, now a brigadier-general.
He personally conducted every company
from the left of the road into a ditch on the right of
the road.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, men,” he said, “and come this way.”
And we did keep cool, for the colonel took the direction
of everything, in spite of the shelling, just as
calmly as if he was carrying out a battalion parade
at home&mdash;a really wonderful performance at a time
like that, and one which completely steadied the lot
of us, though we had got pretty well used to things.</p>

<p>But the Germans did not have a look in for long,
for the Kilties got hold of the gunners and chased them
off. I did not see much of it, except in the distance;
but we heard the shouting as the Jocks got to work
with their bayonets.</p>

<p>As we were going along the road we saw where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Germans had put out of action a whole battery of our
artillery which was standing at the side of the road.
The weather was dull and it started to drizzle, so
that it was not easy to distinguish troops. While
the battery was being knocked out some of our fellows&mdash;the
Loyal North Lancashire, I think&mdash;were advancing
across a field. To protect themselves from the
rain they had covered themselves with their waterproof
sheets. Seeing them, and not being able to tell
who they were, but believing them to be Germans,
our gunners opened fire on them; but what damage
they did I don’t know. That was another of those
things that will happen in war, and it could hardly
be helped, for about this time it was a common dodge
of the Germans to disguise themselves in British
uniforms and attack us before we could tumble to
the trick.</p>

<p>When we had crossed the Aisne and had got into
the hills we had grown wary, and in crossing fields
and open spaces we went in artillery formation, or
“blobbing,” as it is called. This “blobbing” was
a splendid way of saving the lives of men when we
were under fire, for it kept us in platoons closed, but
200 yards between each platoon, and so enabled us
to escape a good many of the bursting shells.</p>

<p>We went along a whole stretch of country till we
reached a small village and billeted there. In the
morning we were on the move again, driving the
Germans from one crest to another, but their position
was too strong for us to shift them any farther, and
then it was a long monotonous job of hanging on and
waiting. They are practically in the same place now.</p>

<p>We did a lot of bayonet work from time to time;
but I can’t say much about it. I know that in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
affair I saw a German. I stuck and he stuck&mdash;and
I don’t remember any more&mdash;one goes insane. I got
a bang on the back of the head from somebody, though
I thought at the time that a stone had been thrown
and had struck me. I remember that day well&mdash;September
14th&mdash;because in addition to the charge I saw
a Jack Johnson for the first time, though we christened
them Black Marias and Coal-boxes then. This
monster burst amongst some French Algerian troops,
and shot a lot of them up into the air, literally blowing
the poor devils to pieces.</p>

<p>On October 19th we marched away and moved by
train, finally getting to Ypres. We dug trenches in
a ditch on the night of the 22nd and occupied them,
and on the morning of the 23rd I went on outpost
duty, little dreaming of the fate that was in store for
me. At that time shells were dropping very heavily
between our line of trenches and a village not far
away which was supposed to be occupied by the
French.</p>

<p>It was about six o’clock in the morning when I
went out with my patrol, of which I was corporal
in charge. There were four of us altogether, and
we were put on outpost duty in what proved to be a
very warm corner. The shelling went on all day,
and we were looking forward to our relief; but it did
not happen to come, and so we had to hold on. The
day passed and the night came, and it was not long
after darkness that we knew that a strong rush was
being made on us by the enemy&mdash;they proved to be
the 213th Landwehr Battalion of Prussian Infantry.</p>

<p>I saw that we were being rushed, and I knew that
our chance of escape was hopeless. I thought very
swiftly just then, and my thought was, “We can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
get away, so we may as well stick it. If we bolt we
shall be shot in the back&mdash;and we might just as well
be shot in the front; it looks better.”</p>

<p>They were on us before we knew where we were,
and to make matters worse, they rushed upon us from
the direction of the village where we supposed the
French to be.</p>

<p>There was a scrap, short and sweet, between our
outpost and the Germans, and almost in the twinkling
of an eye, it seemed, two of my men were killed, one
got away, and I was wounded and captured.</p>

<p>A bullet struck me in the right arm and I fell down,
and the Germans were on me before I knew what was
happening. I still had my equipment on, and to
this fact and the prompt kind act of a wounded German&mdash;let
us be fair and say that not all Germans are
brutes: there are a few exceptions&mdash;I owe my life,
for as soon as I fell a Prussian rushed at me and made
a drive with his bayonet. Just as he did so, a wounded
German who was lying on the ground near me grabbed
me and gave me a lug towards him. At this instant
the bayonet jabbed at me and struck between the
equipment and my wounded arm, just touching my
side. The equipment and the wounded German’s
pull had prevented the bayonet from plunging plump
into me and killing me on the spot, for the steel,
driven with such force, would have gone clean through
my chest. That was the sort of tonic to buck you
up, and I didn’t need a second prick to make me
spring to my feet.</p>

<p>I jumped up, and had no sooner done so than a
second bullet struck me on the wounded arm and
made a fair mess of it, and I knew that this time I
was properly bowled out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>I had fallen down again and was lying on the
ground, bleeding badly; and the next thing I knew
was that I was being stripped. Everything I had on
me, my equipment and my clothing, was taken away;
not for the purpose of letting a doctor examine me,
as one did later, but as part of a system of battlefield
plunder which the Germans have organised.</p>

<p>The very first thing the doctor said when he saw
the wounds was “Donnerwetter!” I was taken to
a barn and left there till morning. I had treatment,
then I was moved into another barn. The Germans
were decent over the business, and there was no
brutality or anything of that kind. I had been taken
from the second barn, and was being carried across
a field, when the ambulance was stopped by a German
doctor who was on horseback. He looked at my arm,
and instantly said that it would have to be amputated
right away, as mortification had set in; and so, lying
on the stretcher, which had been put down in the
field, and round which a small green tarpaulin had
been rigged to keep the wind and cold out, my arm
was taken off. Injections had been made in the arm,
and I felt no pain during the operation, which I
watched with great interest. The doctor who performed
it had studied at Guy’s Hospital and spoke
English well. When I had been removed to a German
hospital in Belgium he saw me every morning,
noon, and night, and I had exactly the same food
as the Germans, while the old inspector of the
hospital used to give me custard and fruit now
and again, when he thought no one was looking;
and I had cigarettes and cigars issued to me just
the same as to their own men.</p>

<p>I was in this hospital in Belgium for a fortnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and was then moved into Germany, being sent to
Münster, in Westphalia, with a lot of wounded Germans.
It seemed as if, in leaving Belgium, I had
said good-bye to civilisation, in view of what happened
during my imprisonment in Germany.</p>

<p>I very soon made acquaintance with German
brutality to British prisoners of war&mdash;brutality and
cowardice, of which I saw constant signs in my captivity;
I say cowardice advisedly, because only a
coward will hit and bully a man who can’t hit
back. On that point, however, there is some consolation.
It was practically a death matter to strike a
German soldier, even under great provocation; but
if you were struck first, you had your remedy, and
nothing pleased a British soldier more than to be
struck, because that gave him his chance, and many
a hard British fist got home on a fat German jowl.
I shall always be thankful to know that I got one or
two in on my own account, though I had only my
left arm to work with. I did not, of course, strike
until I had been struck first; but when I did hit out
I got my own back, with a lot of interest.</p>

<p>That is getting off the track a bit, so I will go
back. At Münster I was taken into a disused circus
which had been turned into a hospital for prisoners,
and when I got there the doctor examined my wound.
It was all raw, but he messed about to that extent
that I fainted. Two mornings afterwards&mdash;they only
dressed us every two mornings&mdash;I was lying on a
table, to be dressed. The job was to be done by a
young German student, a born brute, for I tell
only the plain truth when I say that he deliberately
cut the flesh of my only arm with his lancet and
scissors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“English swine!” he said. “He’s had one arm
off, and he ought to have the other off, too!”</p>

<p>This was the type of fellow who was let loose on
wounded helpless British prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Those dressings were horrible experiences, as a
rule, for I was held down on the table by German
orderlies, who had about as much feeling and compassion
as the table itself.</p>

<p>Let me give another illustration of the German way
of treating wounded British soldiers. Just after
Christmas I was moved into an open camp at Münster,
and the only covering I had was a tarpaulin, the
result being that I caught cold in my wound, and
on January 2nd I was moved back into another
hospital. I knew nothing whatever about the regulations
of the place, so that I saw nothing wrong in
walking along an ordinary looking passage. As I
did this there came towards me a man who corresponds
in rank to our regimental sergeant-major. I
was suffering greatly from my stump, and was quite
helpless; yet this fellow seized me by the scruff of
the neck and the seat of the trousers and threw me
out of the passage&mdash;and it was not till later that I
learned that the passage led to the operating-room,
and that patients were not allowed to use it. Such
a thing could not possibly happen in a British military
hospital containing wounded German soldiers. It is
only fair to say that the food we got in hospital was
good.</p>

<p>Though my wound was not healed, I was sent away
from the hospital and back to the camp. That was
bad in some ways, but it had a fine compensation,
for I was attended by two of our own medical officers
of the Royal Army Medical Corps who were also
prisoners&mdash;Captain Rose and Captain Croker. I
believe they have been exchanged now. I need not
say what a joy it was to be looked after by our own
splendid doctors, after my experience of German
brutality and callousness.</p>

A CONVEYANCE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Time passed slowly and very wearily, and the
monotony became deadly. It was bitterly cold, and
snow fell heavily and constantly till about April. We
did our best to keep cheerful and fit, and were always
thankful when we could get a chance of playing games.
Sometimes we played football with our sentries; but
they were sorry sportsmen, and could not endure
being beaten, even in fair football. There were some
Royal Welsh Fusiliers amongst the prisoners, and
three footballs had been sent out to them. These
footballs reached the camp safely, and everybody
was hugely pleased with them. We got up a match
between a British team and the German sentries, and
beat them six to one. It was a straightforward, honest
match, and a fair and square win; but the Germans
could not stomach it, and for three days our smoking
was stopped. No reason for the stoppage was given;
but we knew well enough what the cause was,
especially as the order applied only to the British
prisoners of war.</p>

<p>I will give another instance of the utter smallness
of the German spirit. On the night of the day when
Italy declared war on Austria we were sitting outside
our wooden huts singing our own National
Anthem, the “Marseillaise,” “Rule, Britannia,” and
lighter compositions such as “Hi! Tiddley hi ti!”&mdash;in
fact, anything that came to mind, just to keep
things moving and cheerful. Then the news of Italy’s
decision came and fairly struck the Germans dumb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
No reason was given for the steps they took against
us&mdash;though we knew perfectly well what the cause
was&mdash;but our smoking was stopped for seven days.
Some of us were locked in the lavatories for twenty-four
hours, and for twenty days our meat was stopped,
so that we were almost starved. And on top of all
this, two Englishmen and a Belgian were sent to a
punishment camp. God knows what happened to
them.</p>

<p>During all this bitter winter weather we were
accommodated in wooden huts, which we had been
put to build ourselves. We did not mind that in
the least, because we were thankful to be employed.
But it was almost impossible to keep warm in the huts,
owing to our scanty clothing and the small number
of stoves. There were two stoves in each room, but
we were only allowed one small box of coal&mdash;sometimes
coke&mdash;daily for each. Generally speaking, the
British prisoners could not get near the stoves because
of the foreign prisoners who crowded around
them, all day long, swathed in a pair of blankets.
To add to the misery of the life, the bedding was
horribly verminous, and we were only allowed to
have one wash a day. That solitary wash was early
in the morning, and we could not get any more,
because the wash-house was closed after 7 a.m.</p>

<p>The food was very poor, and there was not enough
of it. There was plenty of soup of a sort&mdash;and well
there might be, for it was mostly water&mdash;and there
were solids of a kind for which an Englishman has no
liking&mdash;chestnuts, potatoes and horse beans&mdash;poor
stuff after the splendid rations we had had as British
soldiers from our own Army Service Corps. The
drinks were as bad as the solids. We had what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
called coffee given to us; but there was not much
difference between the coffee and the soup. As for
clothing, no real attempt was made to supply us,
though in so many cases we had been stripped naked
when captured. When I went out of camp, just
after Christmas, I had only a pair of trousers and a
pair of sabots, wooden shoes, and I should have fared
badly if I had not been lucky enough to receive an
old cycling jacket which my mother had sent out
to me.</p>

<p>The following statement will show exactly how and
when we were fed each day:&mdash;In the morning, at six
o’clock, we had “coffee,” made from burnt rye, but
nothing to eat; at twelve noon, soup, with a plentiful
supply of water in it and any one of the following
ingredients: chestnuts, potatoes, horse beans, sauerkraut,
acorns. At 12.30 to 1 p.m. there was an issue
of bread, the loaves being about 2½ in. by 6 in.
by 2 in. At 3 p.m. there was “coffee,” as at 6 a.m.,
but nothing to eat; and at 6 p.m. there was soup, as
for dinner, but no meat, fish or cheese. By this
you will see that we had nothing to eat from 6 p.m.
till noon the following day&mdash;a period of eighteen
hours. We had a small piece of meat three times a
fortnight, cheese once a week, and two raw herrings
a week.</p>

<p>As for passing the time, it was one long dreary
“roll on, night.” Cards, draughts, football, and
causing as much trouble as we dared to the Germans,
with a little singing, formed our only means of keeping
sane. Nearly everybody had to work at something
or other, the hours of work being 7 a.m. to
11.30 a.m. (empty stomachs), and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

<p>There was only one occasion when we had a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
change from the bad treatment, and that was when
a batch of German prisoners of war, who had been
in England and exchanged, returned. They must
have told how splendidly they were treated in English
hospitals&mdash;which, as I know, are paradise compared
with German hospitals&mdash;for we were better fed
and looked after for a time. This improvement did
not last long, however, and we went back to the old
ways. Germans can’t keep a good thing going.</p>

<p>German cunning and lying soon made themselves
evident, for under the guise of voluntary work a lot
of the prisoners of war were obliged to work in mines
and ironworks, and by being forced to do these things
they were really helping to fight their own people.</p>

<p>The way the trick was done was this&mdash;Germans
came round and asked prisoners to volunteer to act
as waiters, and a lot of us readily agreed, because
any sort of employment was better than awful idleness.
But the “waiters” soon learned that they
had been shamefully deceived, for they were sent
into mines and ironworks and on to farms. It was no
use to protest, because it was a case of work or no
food. There was so little to eat in the ordinary way
that poor fellows could not face actual starvation,
and so they worked unwillingly. I was asked to go
and work in the fields, but I was quite incapable of
doing this, and so I told the camp commandant, who
put me into the office.</p>

<p>I had had experience of orderly-room work with
the Guards, and felt quite at home at this job&mdash;and
it was interesting, too, for I was in the extraordinary
position of being a sort of censor!</p>

<p>My duty was to handle letters from England for
the prisoners, and see that no news, or cuttings from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
newspapers, or other forbidden things got through.
There were three of us doing this work&mdash;two sergeants
and myself, one sergeant being in charge of
the parcels. I naturally did the best I could for the
prisoners. This office work was both interesting and
exciting, and helped to get the time along.</p>

<p>As for our privations generally, there was nothing
for it but to make the best of them and grin and
bear it. The American Consul at Münster paid two
visits to the camp while I was there, but no good
came of them. Again the crafty German was prepared.
It was known on each occasion that the
Consul was coming&mdash;known two days before he
arrived&mdash;so things were ready for him. He inspected
only a few of the rooms, and the principal result of
the first visit was that our dinner was two hours
late. We made complaints, but nothing came of
them, so when the Consul visited us for the second
time and asked if there were any complaints to make,
we bluntly answered, “No, it’s no good making them,
for nothing’s done.” The Germans instantly published
in the local paper the statement, “The English
are satisfied. They have no complaints.”</p>

<p>Constant attempts were made to escape, and I
fancy that some of the prisoners gave up the whole
of their time to plotting and planning ways of clearing
out. The chance of getting away was small, because
at night the camp, buildings as well as compounds,
was brilliantly lighted by big electric arc lamps, and
there were sentries and barbed wire entanglements
everywhere. But in spite of all precautions several
Belgians and a few Englishmen and Frenchmen
escaped, and we were immensely pleased when we
heard that one Belgian had got away by stealing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
commandant’s motor-car and bolting in it. I did not
hear what became of him.</p>

<p>Brutal punishments were inflicted for the most
trivial offences, such as smoking in forbidden places,
and a common method was to tie a prisoner to a post,
with his feet deep in snow, and leave him there for
two hours, with an armed sentry over him. The poor
wretch dare not move, if he did the brave warrior
with the gun kicked him&mdash;the German is a fine hand
at hitting when the other chap can’t hit back. This
savage cruelty had a terrible effect on some of the
victims, and helped to make them the life-long wrecks
that they now are.</p>

<p>From Münster I was sent to Brussels for exchange.
We were quartered in the Royal Academy, and
naturally enough the Belgian women and children
tried to give us things. When this was seen, the
German wounded who were in the building were
ordered to turn the hose on, and they did. It was a
great laugh, though, for it took them four hours to
fix the hose&mdash;and then it would not work properly.</p>

<p>The authorities suddenly decided that I should not
be exchanged, because I was a non-commissioned
officer, and I was sent to Wesel on the Rhine, where
I stayed six weeks. I had to go into hospital again,
because my wound would not heal&mdash;it never got a
sporting chance. Ill treatment continued, and for
reasons, mostly revenge, which Britishers would
scorn. The chief of this hospital was an old man
whose only son had been lost in a submarine that had
been sunk by the British. I saw that something was
wrong as soon as he appeared in the morning, and I
felt that we should get it hot, though I did not know
how.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The old doctor had all the English prisoners sent
for, and incredible as it may seem, every wound that
was healed was deliberately reopened and plugged,
while wounds that were not healed were probed inside
and all the newly-formed flesh was destroyed. Many
of us suffered terribly for a long time as the result of
the visit to us of the old man who had lost his son in
fair fight.</p>

<p>My wound was finally healed on July 25th, exactly
nine months from the day on which my arm was
taken off.</p>

<p>My sole object now was to get away from the
horrible country and the more horrible people, and,
thank God, I managed to do it. The refusal to exchange
me was a bitter blow, but I soon pulled up
and set to work to get away. Accordingly, when I
reached Wesel, I reported myself as a private, and
I was reckoned as a private and put in the list for
exchange. I was sent to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>Soon after this I came away with other prisoners
of war, and one of the most glorious moments
of my life was when I set eyes again on Old
England.</p>

<p>There is one strange incident that I have kept to
the last.</p>

<p>I have said that when I was shot on outpost I was
stripped. My jacket must have been thrown aside,
for next day a chum of mine picked it up and put
it in his pack, thinking I had been killed, and meaning
to bring it home, if he lived, as a relic. During
many a long day and hard fight he carried that extra
burden in his pack&mdash;no little thing to do&mdash;then he
himself was wounded and sent home. He brought
my jacket with him, and now I have it, and shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
always treasure it as a memento of my war-days.
The jacket is smothered in blood.</p>

<p>There are about 28,000 Britishers still in Germany,
suffering as I suffered&mdash;some worse. They want
releasing. The only way to release them is to end
the war, and the only way to end the war is the cooperation
of every man and woman, old and young,
rich and poor, working for one object&mdash;<span class="smcap">Victory</span>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pcn">GASSED NEAR HILL 60</p>

<p class="pch">[When the Germans plunged the civilised world into this
appalling war, one of their big hopes was that the sons of the
Motherland would desert her in the hour of her greatest need.
Never was a greater miscalculation made, even in a war which
has become notorious for enemy miscalculations, for her
Colonies rallied round Great Britain in a manner that has
covered them with lasting glory. A particularly splendid
contingent hurried over from Canada to our shores, and went
into the most severe training, lasting through an uncommonly
bad winter. In due course it left England, and entered almost
at once into some of the hardest and most deadly fighting of
the whole campaign&mdash;the conflict at the village of St. Julien,
in the region of the famous Hill 60, where many troops fell
gloriously in repelling the attempts of the Germans to hack
their way through to Calais. In their determination to succeed,
the Germans deliberately adopted the devilish device of
poison-gas. How even that cowardly expedient failed is told
in this story by Lance-Corporal R. G. Simmins, of the 8th
Battalion Canadian Infantry, 90th Winnipeg Rifles.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">When I</span> recall my experiences at the front, I am
particularly struck by the circumstance that the
thing which stands out most clearly in my mind is
not the actual campaigning, not the long and weary
times in the trenches, not even artillery, rifle, or
bayonet work, but the coming of the poison-gas. I
myself was gassed in the furious fighting at St. Julien.</p>

<p>I will get right at things quickly. Towards the
end of April the Canadian Division was holding a
line near Ypres, which was not far short of three
miles in extent. That line ran north-west from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Poelcapelle-Paschendaile Road, and at the end joined
up with the French. Three infantry brigades with
artillery comprised the division, the first being in
reserve, the second on the right of the third, and the
third connecting with the French.</p>

<p>We were in the salient of Ypres which was known
to be weak, but the holding of which was of vast
importance. I am proud to think that I am one of
the Canadian Contingent to whom the big task of
keeping back the German hosts at that point was
given, and that I fought with men who gave their
lives in stopping the German attempt to hack a
way through to Calais, so as to have a very near
blow at England. Placed as we were placed, it was
possible to see the battle being fought on three sides,
and this was uncommonly interesting.</p>

<p>We were, of course, in trenches, quite near the
Germans, but between us there ran a ridge which
is known as a hogback, so that there was a somewhat
formidable natural barrier between the opposing
forces. We were so near to the famous Hill 60 that
we heard the explosion there and the subsequent
battle when we were in billets at Ypres. The hill
had been mined with six or seven tons of dynamite,
the explosion of which was enough to change even
the appearance of the hill.</p>

<p>There was a fine smart affair on the night of
April 17th, when about a mile of German trenches
was taken, and I saw about 2000 German prisoners
being escorted away. Their uniforms were shabby,
and their equipment was not what it ought to have
been, but the men themselves appeared to be remarkably
fit and well cared for.</p>

<p>We had gone into the trenches after marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
through Ypres, where the chimney-pots were tumbling
about our ears, and we were expecting very hot
times; but the hogback prevented us from seeing
the Germans, and of course kept us out of their
sight. But there were German snipers everywhere,
and they took good care to harass us.</p>

<p>I had charge of a section of bomb-throwers, and
we did our best to hurl these strange but quite
legitimate weapons at the enemy. At first the bombs
were homely contrivances, made of jam-tins filled
with explosives; but later they were made under
War Office control, and were far superior to the
primitive articles which we manufactured ourselves.</p>

<p>In such a war and in such a place it is not easy
to tell of what was done by individuals, because so
many splendid acts are unobserved; but I call to
mind the coolness and resource of my own platoon
officer, Lieutenant McLeod. He was dashing all over
the place, encouraging his men at every point, and
doing things all round in fine style. I was talking
to him quite a lot in the thick of things, and was
specially struck by his calmness and the wonderful
effect his example had upon the men.</p>

<p>One outstanding performance of his was to run,
in broad daylight, from battalion headquarters to
the trenches&mdash;a pretty brave achievement, when you
bear in mind that a running man presents an almost
certain target to snipers.</p>

<p>In this connection, I call to mind the case of a
section commander who was in a trench. He wished
that a certain thing should be done, and by way of
indicating his desire he held up his hand, with palm
extended. That must have been a small enough
target, in all conscience, but it was no sooner in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
air than it was pierced by five German bullets. If a
hand can be so effectively fired at, what chance to
escape has the body of a man?</p>

<p>This trench warfare was uncommonly exhausting.
You never knew what was going to happen, or what
you would be called upon to do; but it was astonishing
to find how soon you could adapt yourself to circumstances.</p>

<p>I recall an occasion when we had been forced to
retire at one point and get into a communication
trench; we were taken aback by the discovery that
it was not deep enough. We had to dig ourselves in.
That was not a hard matter for the boys who had
their entrenching-tools, but I had lost mine, and the
only thing left to do was to try rabbit tactics. So
I began to dig myself in with my fingers, and I have
a distinct recollection of tearing and scooping at the
ground like an animal scuttling for shelter. Luckily
the ground was soft and yielding, or I should not
have had a chance with such poor tools. As it was,
my fingers were torn and bleeding long before the
digging-in process was completed.</p>

<p>I have given you a general understanding of the
task that fell to the Canadian Contingent to accomplish;
but as I have said, it is not the actual fighting
that dwells in one’s memory.</p>

<p>We soon settled down to the ordinary ways of
war, and took them as a matter of course. While in
training in England we had heard and read a good
deal about the fighting, and had become accustomed
to it; while as for any such discomforts as heavy
rain and sodden ground, they did not trouble us. Not
even Flanders could give us worse trials of this sort
than we had known while wintering on Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys took the fighting and the hardships as
part of the day’s work, and there was neither grumbling
nor protesting; but that state of things was
changed like magic when there was sprung upon us
the most cowardly, dastardly, and dirty means of
fighting that the world has ever known. This was
the use of poison-gas by the Germans&mdash;a device
which instantly put them out of consideration as
civilised combatants, and stamped them for ever as
dishonourable soldiers of a dishonoured country.</p>

<p>This poison-gas came upon us unseen, insidiously,
and without the slightest warning in the one case;
and in the other it rolled down upon us literally as
a cloud.</p>

<p>It is hard to speak calmly of this unprecedented
form of warfare, but I will try to tell exactly what
happened, and I think I can do that, because when
I was a medical student I particularly interested
myself in chemistry.</p>

<p>It was on Saturday, the 24th, that our Brigade
had their first experience of gas. We had been
shelling the German trenches all day, and were
standing to, expecting an attack by the enemy. We
naturally looked for the employment of the usual
methods, and were ready to receive the Germans
when they showed themselves. We were strongly
entrenched, and many a keen eye was kept on the
hostile ground, watching for the appearance of the
enemy. But not a sight of a German was to be had;
there was no commotion, no excitement, no appearance
of anything uncanny or uncommon, yet there
was coming towards us a German weapon which was
neither honest artillery nor small arms&mdash;poison-gas.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen in the air, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
suddenly, and without any apparent cause, we were
overpowered by a smell exactly like nasturtium, but
infinitely stronger and more pungent. The similarity
noticed is remarkable, for doesn’t nasturtium come
from Latin words which really mean a nose-twister?
Anyway, there we were in our trenches, unexpectedly
overpowered by a horrible acrid smell and an invisible
gas.</p>

<p>A lot of the boys&mdash;fine, splendid, honest fellows,
who did not understand the meaning of any kind of
warfare that is not honourable and aboveboard, were
utterly unable to fathom the mystery, and they
seemed to think that it was the kind of pest that had
to be taken with the other discomforts of campaigning
in the Low Country.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is it?” they asked.</p>

<p>It was not until the whole unspeakable visitation
was over that most of the men realised what had
happened, and that the Germans had tried to blind
us as a preliminary to annihilation. Like so many
more of the German hopes, this did not develop on
the lines that had been planned.</p>

<p>This was the first poison-gas attack that we experienced,
and I am thankful to say that on the
whole it was a failure; but when you remember that
we were utterly unready for such a filthy form of
fighting, and that we had no means of combating it
or nullifying its effects, you will realise the extreme
disadvantage of the contest from the point of view
of the Canadians.</p>

<p>I have said that it was about four o’clock in the
afternoon when we had our first experience of the
poison-gas. Now that I am talking of the thing it
strikes me as a strange coincidence that it was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
about four o’clock in the morning when we had our
second visitation.</p>

<p>We had got into our stride and settled down to
hard hammering and what you might call routine
campaigning. Then came the morning of Saturday,
April 24th, when the sun rose ten minutes before
five o’clock, which means that at about four o’clock
day was breaking.</p>

<p>Most of us were asleep; but in war time there is
no such thing as universal rest for men, and our
sentries were posted and keeping watchful eyes upon
the German lines. It is said that the darkest hour
comes just before the dawn, and I think there is no
doubt that man’s lowest vitality is reached at that
particular period. At any rate, the Germans probably
thought so, for they planned a specially fatal attack
upon us in the grey hours of this April morning.</p>

<p>While looking round in the cheerless dawn one or
two of our sentries saw a yellowish kind of cloud
coming towards us, over the hogback, and travelling
pretty fast. The sight was unusual enough to be
noticed, but no one who saw it had the slightest idea
what it really was, until we were enveloped in the
filthy folds; then we knew that it was poison-gas.</p>

<p>The cloud rolled on, and as it got quite close to
us I noticed that it was about eight feet or twelve
feet high, a deep, dense yellow at the bottom, and
becoming lighter towards the top, so diffuse, indeed,
that it was almost indistinguishable from the atmosphere.
It is not easy exactly to convey an understanding
of what the cloud really was, because few
men have ever seen anything like it; but it might
well be described as a moving mass of yellow, fat
filth, insufferably loathsome. The poison-gas, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
chief constituent of which I took to be chlorine, was
about twice as heavy as air, and, consequently, it
travelled along the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>I saw the yellow cloud come, I watched it as it
enveloped us, and I observed it as it rolled away
behind us and went towards Ypres, gradually losing
force as it was absorbed in the air. In addition to
being so favourably situated, we had just had a rum
ration&mdash;and plenty of it. I do not know whether the
spirit did us any good, but it certainly did not do us
the least harm, and may have helped to nullify the
effects of the poison-gas.</p>

<p>Our salient, vulnerable and undoubtedly attractive
to the Germans, was rushed by them, and they
succeeded in breaking through and occupying a
trench about a hundred yards away from our own
and parallel with it. They came on with wonderful
steadiness, advancing just as if they were on parade,
scarcely breaking step at all. They came out of their
trenches about a dozen at a time, formed two long
lines, and literally seemed to walk over into the
trench, though we were peppering at them all the
time. They kept up an excellent covering fire, with
the result that a good many of our own men were
shot.</p>

<p>This was fair, open fighting, the sort of thing that
a soldier expects, and into the spirit of which he can
enter. It gave opportunities, too, for the display of
the best qualities of warfare, and these were shown
by a man I knew very well, Company Sergeant-Major
F. W. Hall, of my company. In spite of a very
heavy and at that time fatal fire, the sergeant-major
rushed out from the shelter of his trench to bring
in a wounded man who was lying in the open. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
seemed to bear a charmed life, for he got clear of the
trench and was untouched by the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major managed, by good fortune
which seemed miraculous, to get as far as the wounded
man; he seized him and started with his burden for
safety. In fact he actually got him as far as the
trench, then, when the worst seemed over and security
was just within his reach, when he was getting over
the parapet and men were loudly cheering him because
of his success, he was shot and killed. But the uncommon
courage of the action had been noticed, and
later on, to the real gratification of all the Canadians,
and especially those who knew him, the announcement
was made that the dead hero had been awarded
the Victoria Cross. Hall’s men were terribly shattered
by the enemy’s rifle and machine-gun fire; but in
spite of it all they held their ground, and the living
remnant won great glory.</p>

<p>It was not long before I dropped. I did not
recover till the fight had swept away to my right.
Then I reported to an artillery officer who was near,
and he showed me the way to Ypres, telling me also
to go into the city for hospital treatment.</p>

<p>I cannot close my yarn without mention of Captain
Northwood’s Company&mdash;No. 4. The company was
not relieved&mdash;it could not be, because of the heavy
call on troops&mdash;but it fought on doggedly till two
platoons were captured. Yet there were no prisoners
made except at a bitter cost to the Germans.</p>

<p>There were many heroes that day in No. 4 Company.
I cannot name them all, but I must mention two of
them who stand out pre-eminent&mdash;“Box-car” Kelly
(now a King’s Corporal), and Corporal Sandford.
Kelly did everything in his power to rally some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the British troops who were near him, while Sandford,
a section-commander, did as much by his
example of splendid courage as any officer I know.</p>

<p>That is my story.</p>

<p>If space permitted I might tell of Corporal Degan
and his gallant band of hand-grenaders; how they
bravely fought when hemmed in by the enemy; of
Lieutenant Owens, who stood with an automatic
pistol in each hand, cheering and swearing in the
same breath, defending his comrades and destroying
the Germans; of Sergeant Nobel (now a captain), who
repaired a telephone-wire under an annihilating
cannonade from German guns, and a score of other
splendid fellows who utterly forgot themselves and
their extremity, and risked their all upon the hazard
of the glorious common cause.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pcn">A LINESMAN IN GALLIPOLI</p>

<p class="pch">[A vivid understanding of the work which our soldiers did
in Gallipoli during the earlier stages of the operations in the
Dardanelles, and of the strange happenings which were of
daily occurrence in fighting the German-led Turks, is given
by this story, which is told by Private John Frank Gray,
5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">Everybody</span> knows how the transport <i>River Clyde</i>,
with two thousand British soldiers packed in her,
was deliberately run ashore on V Beach, at the
southern point of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Great
holes had been cut in her steel sides, to make doors
through which the men could get ashore when she
was hard and fast, without embarking in any sort
of craft. Land they did, in the end, though they
suffered heavily through the Turks’ terrific fire. I
did not see that famous and wonderful performance,
but I disembarked, with my regiment, close to the
transport while she was still aground. We had
almost the same experience as the troops from the
<i>River Clyde</i> had gone through. We forced a landing,
in spite of barbed wire entanglements in the water,
traps which had caught many a fine fellow and held
him till the enemy’s fire got him. It is odd to talk
of wire entanglements in the sea, grabbing and tearing
you as you plunge into the water, to wade ashore;
but there they were, one more new feature in a war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that has been full of strange and devilish things.
Before we landed in Gallipoli we had experience of
transport, trawler, barge and pinnace; and we were
no sooner at the end of the voyage from England
than we were under deadly fire and in the thick of it.</p>

<p>We went right into the firing-line, and the Turks
gave us more than a warm reception&mdash;it was hot.
We were under fire all the time we were landing, but
we had the uncommon good luck to suffer no loss.
As we forced our way ashore we saw plenty of evidence
of the desperate nature of the adventure of the men
of the <i>River Clyde</i>; but we were too much absorbed
in our own affairs to pay much heed to what had
happened to other fellows.</p>

<p>We had got ashore on July 16th at Seddul Bahr,
and stayed there all night. So that we should be
as comfortable as possible we made dug-outs in the
face of the cliff. The cliff at that place is very hard,
and we had plenty of blasting to do, as well as work
with pick and shovel.</p>

<p>My mates and I had put plenty of elbow-grease
into our own particular job, and had finished our
dug-out and got into it, to be cosy for the night.
It was very much like animals going to bed. We
were worn out, and lost no time in going to sleep. I
had gone off soundly and knew nothing till I was
roughly roused by some fellows shouting, “Wake
up! Wake up! Three of our chaps are buried
alive!”</p>

<p>We did not need a second rousing. We all sprang
up and rushed to a spot not far away, where we saw
that there had been a fall of earth and rock, and
we dug harder than we had ever dug before. At
the end of it, having dug to a depth of three feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and thrown the earth and rock away from us, we
came across three poor chaps of my company who
had been buried by a fall of earth, caused by them
digging too far into the ground to give them shelter.
They had undermined too much, and the earth-roof
had collapsed and crushed them. We saw at once
that there was no hope&mdash;the men looked as if they
had been killed on the spot: they must have been
dead an hour&mdash;but we put them on stretchers and
the field ambulance men did all they could. But it
was too late. Next day we dug graves for them
and put crosses over. There are some fine graveyards
out there, well cared for, and with barbed
wire fences to preserve them. While we were burying
our comrades the Turks fired on us continuously, and
this had to serve as the last volleys over the fallen.
That solemn and tragic beginning of my experiences
after landing at Gallipoli will never fade from my
mind.</p>

<p>Even at this early stage I noticed the extraordinary
luck of war. Some of the King’s Own Lancasters
had been in the trenches for fourteen days, and
during the whole of that time they had had only
twenty casualties. They left the trenches and came
right up alongside of us, on a little bit of a mound.
The Turks must have got wind that a lot of troops
were on the move, for the shrapnel came bursting
over the lot of us, especially the Lancasters, who in
less than half an hour lost more than forty men,
fourteen being killed and the rest wounded. Four or
five of our own fellows were hit, so that we escaped
lightly, and were able to send our stretcher-bearers
to give a hand in getting the wounded soldiers to
hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The burying alive of men and the loss of men who
had spent a fortnight in the trenches unscathed, were
the things I saw when I was spending my first night
in Gallipoli, so I can very fairly say that we landed
right in the thick of it. It was a hot start, and it
did not get cooler, for on the following morning,
when we were on the way to the trenches at Achi
Baba, we were under constant shrapnel fire. We
crawled and crept up as best we could, using roads,
or rather tracks, which had been made by the 29th
Division. It was fearfully hot, we were heavily
laden, and there was nothing but prickly scrub and
rock and stifling dust about, and bursting shell all
the time. But we forged slowly ahead, making the
best of it, and thankful when we got into one of
the little ravines which abound there, and make
first-rate natural trenches&mdash;thankful because we got
shelter without having to dig for it. In this advance
some of our chaps fell, and the ravines formed their
resting-places. The graves were filled in and crosses
put over to tell how the soldiers had died. I might
say here that whenever it was possible to do so, an
Army chaplain read the Burial Service; but often
enough a funeral had to take place with no chaplain
near at hand.</p>

<p>An advance like this is a slow business. You go
in single file, keeping your heads well down, because
of the stray bullets from snipers. The Turkish
snipers are dead shots&mdash;I will tell you more about
them later. At the end of our dodging and ducking
and crawling in single file we got into a support
trench, and I began to breathe a bit more freely,
because I thought that here at any rate I was safe.
But we had no sooner reached the front-line trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
than the Turks started shelling us, and very quickly
I thought that the very end of me had come. There
was a tremendous crash just overhead, then a horrible
rumbling, then I was knocked down in a heap, and
all I knew was that a shell had burst in the trench
and that I was buried in a mass of earth and rock.
I was bruised and stunned&mdash;so were four of my
chums who were near me; but we had had better
luck than the three poor fellows who had been
buried by the fall of earth above them, and pretty
soon we had worried our way out of the heap of
muck and were staring at each other&mdash;and I shall
never forget that incident, if it is only because of
the stupid way in which we stared at each other,
and never said a word. We were making tea when
the shell burst, and were looking forward to a cosy
meal; but here we were, staring at each other in
surprise, wondering what the dickens the matter
was, till we looked around and saw what sorry objects
we were, and that the tea gear had been scattered
all over the place. When we had got over our
fright&mdash;and what’s the use of saying that we weren’t
scared?&mdash;we saw the grim humour of it, and laughed
and pulled ourselves together, thankful that we were
still in the land of the living.</p>

<p>That was part of our early introduction to shell
fire, and we very soon learned that you never know
what sort of a trick a shell is up to. Shells are very
deceiving. You hear their peculiar and horrible
whistle and think that they are going to burst anywhere
except where they do.</p>

<p>When we had pulled ourselves together we left our
shattered trench and went into another part of the
trench, to pull round a bit and get out of the shrapnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bombardment. But within three hours we were
back again and settled down, wondering what the
coming night had in store for us. We were in for
another surprise, though at that time, of course, we
did not know it.</p>

<p>This surprise took the shape of an attack upon us
by hand-grenades, or bombs. It was pitch dark; but
the blackness was lit up near us in patches, caused
by the explosion of the bombs. We got half a dozen
of them, and as it was clear that some Turks had
crept towards us from their firing-line, which was
only about 200 yards away, we sent out a sergeant
and five or six men to hunt the bomb-throwers. You
might as well have looked for a needle in a haystack
as try to find Turks who were hiding in the darkness
in the shrubs or the ravines; at any rate, our chaps
did not see or hear anything of the Turks, and they
had to come back without doing anything. There
was no doubt that the Turks had crept up to us
quite close and then hurled their bombs; but we were
lucky to escape with only one man slightly wounded,
though if the bombers had had any luck we should
have been blown to pieces. These intensely dark
nights were always very trying because of these
attacks. It was an immense relief when the moonlight
nights came, because then the Turks dared not
try their tricks on. There was always the guard, of
course, two hours on and two hours off. This gave a
great sense of protection; but the guard work itself gave
you the creeps. You were on the rack all the time,
fancying that you saw some one approaching when
as a matter of fact there was no one near. There
was always the chance, too, of being picked off by
a sniper who used horrible explosive bullets. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of our men was struck down, and when we went up
to him and removed his helmet we saw at once that
an explosive bullet had been used, for the skull was
completely shattered. You could always tell when
these awful things had been used, from the appearance
of the sandbags. The bullets would strike and
explode, and smash the sandbags so badly that it
took us all our time to make the damage good.
You dare not put even a periscope above the trench;
if you did a sniper got a bullet through it before you
knew where you were.</p>

<p>It was all tremendously exciting, and there was
never a chance of being dull or downhearted. The
system of trenches was amazing, turning and twisting
everywhere in the most wonderful manner. We
made the most of these complications, too, by naming
the trenches Oxford Street, Regent Street, and so on,
with Clapham Junction and the like for important
junctions of trenches. These names, which were
chalked up or put on boards, were most useful in
helping you to find your way about, and sometimes
very amusing misunderstandings arose.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Oxford Circus is?” a chap
asked me one day.</p>

<p>“Rather!” I told him, proud to throw light on
his ignorance, and I began to tell him, till he cut
me short by snapping that he wasn’t talking about
London, but the trenches. We got many a good
laugh out of these little misunderstandings; for out
at the front you are always ready to make the most
of the smallest joke. You needed all the cheerfulness
you could get, too, because of the awful sights that
constantly met you and the endless peril you were
in. I shall never forget one of the very first things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
my eyes saw in those opening days of my campaigning
in Gallipoli. We got to the spot at Achi Baba where
the Munsters and the Dublin Fusiliers, during a
gallant advance, had been enfiladed by machine-gun
fire and literally mown down. From the trench we
had occupied we could see the men lying just as
they had fallen, while trying to take cover. There
they were, on the open ground, absolutely riddled
with bullets, and with their packs on, and their rifles
and bayonets and everything else. They had been
lying there for about a fortnight, because it was
impossible to do anything in the way of burying
them, owing to the enemy’s incessant fire and sniping.</p>

<p>Things hereabouts were particularly horrible. We
went into a Turkish trench that had been taken, and
started to make a fire-trench. We pulled away the
old sandbags and dug away at the parapet with our
picks. There was a horrible stench, but we were
used to smells and did not take much notice of it
till we found that the picks had a lot of foul stuff
on them which we could not account for; but we
soon discovered that the parapet was composed of
the dead bodies of Turks which had been piled up
and just covered with earth, the sandbags being
placed on the top of the wall of corpses.</p>

<p>In this same trench there was a well which had
been covered with planks. Naturally enough we
began to explore it, not that we expected to get
anything to drink from it, and when we had removed
the planks we found that the well, which we calculated
was ten or twelve feet deep, had a lot of dead
Turks in it. We counted six of them, and had
enough of the job, so we put the planks back, and
felt that our curiosity had been satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had been there four or five days and
were getting used to the appearance of the country,
we saw a Turk just peeping over the top of a little
mound, with his rifle pointing towards us and in the
attitude of firing. We felt sure that we had caught
a sniper, and two or three shots were promptly fired.
The Turk was still there, and it was clear that he
had been shot. Later on we were able to get near
him, and then we saw that he was black with flies
and had been shot through the eye while sniping;
but not shot by us, because when we shook him his
head fell off, showing that he had been dead for
some time. We saw another Turk who was sitting
against a tree. We went up and found that he, too,
was dead. He looked a mere skeleton; but he was
swathed in clothing and equipment in the most
extraordinary fashion. His trousers were all rags,
and his tunic was all patches of differently coloured
cloths; he had three shirts and two belts on, and we
wondered how he had stuck so many clothes in such
stifling weather.</p>

<p>I had an exciting adventure one day&mdash;a bit too
exciting to be altogether pleasant. I and another
chap had been sent out to an artillery position which
was called Clapham Junction Station, to get some
corrugated iron. We had a long way&mdash;two and a
half miles&mdash;to go, and it was necessary to keep to
the cover of the trenches whenever we could do so.
We were able to do that for most of the way, going
through the very trenches which had been dug by
the poor chaps of the Munsters and Dublin Fusiliers
who had fallen. We got to the end of our journey,
quite near the French lines, and then started back
with our corrugated iron. Burdened in this way, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
found that one of the trenches was too narrow for
us to get along, and we were forced to make our way
across open country for about 500 yards. As soon
as we left the shelter of the trench the sun shone
on our galvanised metal and gave the Turks a good
target. We promptly had three or four shells
bursting near us, and we lost no time in doubling
over the open ground, staggering along with the
iron sheets, and thankful when we were under shelter
again, with a farewell shell or two to show us what
a narrow squeak we had had. I picked up one of
these shells, which had not burst, and kept it a long
time, meaning to bring it home as a souvenir, but
I found it a nuisance and had to throw it away.</p>

<p>We were constantly seeing strange sights and
learning how cunning the Turks were. One morning
I saw some Australians bring in a Turk who was
wearing one of our uniforms. The tunics had white
patches on them, so that our artillery could distinguish
us, and it was one of these that the fellow
wore. He had no doubt taken it from a dead British
soldier, and so dressed, he had joined a party of
Australians who were drawing water at a well. He
kept his mouth shut, and might have gone undiscovered,
but he and an Australian began quarrelling,
then fighting, and that gave him away, because he
could not speak English. They shot him, as a spy,
the following morning.</p>

<p>At the same place&mdash;I am now speaking of W Beach,
where we were resting&mdash;we saw a Turkish sniper on
the top of a hill. We sent out two or three times to
try and get him, but failed; but at last he was caught
while robbing one of our fellows who was dead. The
sniper had shot him, and now he was out for plunder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
When we had this sniper in hand we found that we
had got hold of a very dangerous customer, a man
who had done a lot of mischief amongst our fellows.
He had gone about his sniping in a very business-like
way, and had established himself in a spot which
commanded points which had to be continually
passed by our stretcher-bearers and working parties.
A good many of the R.A.M.C. chaps were hit, and it
was curious that most of the wounds were about the
knee. We discovered that these wounds were the
result of the sniper’s low firing&mdash;he was very near
the ground and had pretty nearly complete control
of this particular spot. Our fellows used to double
round it for all they were worth, but they were not
fast enough to dodge the Turk’s bullets. When we
examined his dug-out we found three rifles fixed on
tripods, which were always trained on the spots
where our fellows had to pass. In addition to that
he had a machine-gun, and this he used for firing
on our men when he knew that it was meal-time
and that they were in clusters. It was a great relief
when his account was settled.</p>

<p>Aircraft fighting has developed enormously during
the war, and I saw an exciting fight between three
of our aeroplanes and two of the Turks. We had
got a bit used to aeroplanes, for a Taube had swooped
over us and dropped a chance bomb which blew
up the quartermaster’s stores. Three bombs fell
about a hundred yards away, and I noticed that
the noise they made when they came through the
air was just like the whistle of a railway engine.
In the fight I am talking about our fellows brought
down one of the Turkish machines, and they made
a hard chase after the other, but it got away. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was a really thrilling fight, and our chaps got tremendously
excited over it. We had been warned
of an attack from the air by three blasts on a
whistle, and that was the signal to take shelter
and to cover up the guns with tarpaulins, to hide
them. During these attacks you are supposed
never to look up, but the fight was so splendid
and our chaps got so excited that the warning was
forgotten in many cases, and chaps were peeping over
the parapets and some were actually standing up on
the parapets. Poor fellows! Turkish snipers spotted
them and got three with their bullets. I was only
about a hundred yards away when they were killed.
Their loss, which was a lesson to all of us, cast quite
a gloom over our victory in the air.</p>

<p>After being in the trenches at Achi Baba for
sixteen days we went back to Lemnos, a big naval
base about four and a half hours’ distant by transport.
We were supposed to have a week’s rest, but we were
at Lemnos only three days. At the end of that time
we went back to the Peninsula and landed at Anzac,
and went straight up to the firing-line, which had
been made at Chunuk Bahr&mdash;and our regiment got
absolutely cut up. It was one of the things that
<i>will</i> happen in a war like this.</p>

<p>We had gone up into the trenches and nothing
much happened while we were there. After our
spell in the trenches we were taken up into a gulley
for twenty-four hours’ rest and sleep. We were in
high spirits at the prospect of such a change, and
we took our equipment off and made a few dug-outs
and got into them and settled down, and very comfortable
and contented we were. But our rest and
peace were smashed at dawn on the following morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when we were thrown into confusion by a heavy
Turkish attack. The Turks had advanced into the
firing-line on the opposite side of the hill. There
were plenty of them and they had machine-guns,
while we were quite helpless, having no rifles nor
equipment&mdash;indeed, many of us had not even our
jackets on, as we were taking it easy.</p>

<p>There was quite a stampede for the time being,
and some one passed the order, “Every man for
himself!” It was a mistake, I am certain, but it
added immensely to the confusion. That awful
alarm caused some of our unarmed chaps to make a
bolt for it, the result of temporary panic; and now
came one of those splendid bits of work which are
the pride of every regiment, and which no one can
do better than British soldiers.</p>

<p>The adjutant, Captain Belcher, rallied about
seventy of the men. He pulled them together, put
heart of grace into them, and shouted to them to get
their rifles and bayonets and follow him. There is
nothing like an heroic example at such a time. The
little band rallied round the adjutant, and with wild
cheers and a gallant rush they hurled themselves
upon the Turks, and such was the suddenness and
fury of their attack that the Turks bolted like
children&mdash;and big hefty chaps they were&mdash;with our
fellows, some of them almost as small as dwarfs,
tearing after them with the bayonet. In this furious
affair one of our men got wounded and could not
walk. The adjutant picked him up and began to
carry him away. As he did so the Turks opened fire
on him with a machine-gun, and he must have been
riddled&mdash;I never saw anything more of him. At
the same time Lieutenant Ratcliffe, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wounded, was being carried off on a stretcher. He
seemed to think that the chance of escape was hopeless,
and so he said to his bearers, “Put me down
and look after yourselves, boys. I shall be all
right.” It was a hard thing to do, but the men
obeyed, and all of us who could do so got away from
that fatal spot, which we were far too weak to hold,
in spite of the success of the adjutant’s rally, and
at last we got back to the beach.</p>

<p>It was then that we compared notes and heard
of what had happened in various places, and the roll
having been called we supposed that every man who
could escape had reached the beach. But two nights
afterwards we formed a search party, and went back
up the hill and were lucky enough to find and bring
back with us about a dozen poor fellows who had
been lying all that time on the battlefield. From
this rescue we supposed that there must be other
men alive at the top of the hill; but there was no
chance of reaching them in the daytime, and we could
not go at night, for the searchlights from our own
warships swept the hillside and lit it up so brilliantly
that any search party would have been shown up
to the snipers. So we did no more, and soon we
were forgetting; for we were hard at work on fatigue,
helping the Engineers to build a new firing-line, a
trench about 1400 yards long. Then happened a
thing so strange that it seemed beyond belief, like
men rising from the dead. Fifteen days had passed
since the fight, and no one dreamed that there could
possibly be survivors, yet there appeared at the
beach headquarters two terribly worn and haggard
men, Lance-Corporal A. G. Scott of my company,
and Private R. Humphries, another of our chaps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
We were amazed to see them, and far more amazed
to hear their story, which was that they and Private
W. J. Head had been up in the hill for fifteen days
and nights, unable to get away, and living on the
biscuits and water that they had taken from the
haversacks and bottles of dead men. The Turks,
they said, used to pass them and shake hands with
them, but would never give them any food or water.
The three used to grope about in the daytime to
get food and drink, and the Turks sniped at them
whenever they got the chance. Head was quite
unable to escape, having had two bad wounds.
Scott and Humphries, desperate at last, crawled
away and managed to reach our regimental headquarters
and tell their wonderful story, and it was
no sooner heard than a search party was organised,
and, with Scott and Humphries as guides, went back
to the old fighting-place&mdash;a slow and dangerous job.
On the first night they found nothing, but on the
next night the relieving party came across three
fellows and brought them down. Head was amongst
them&mdash;he had been out getting more biscuits and
water, and while doing so his right arm was smashed
by a machine-gun which was trained on him. The
body of the poor lieutenant was found, with several
bayonet wounds, and he, like all the other officers
who fell, had been completely stripped by plunderers.
The bodies had not a thing on them.</p>

<p>The survivors of those awful days and nights on
the hillside&mdash;from August 10th to August 26th&mdash;had
such a welcome as can be given only to those who
return when they have been given up as lost, and
Scott and Head and Humphries have been awarded
the Distinguished Conduct Medal. There have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
some extraordinary incidents in this war, but not
many are stranger than this adventure of this little
band of men for what must have seemed an endless
fortnight, and none that will stand out more finely
in the annals of the Wiltshires.</p>

<p>There was so much to be seen and done in the
three months I spent in the Near East that it is
not easy to describe everything, and I must now
mention only one or two things more. Very clearly
in my mind stands out our attack on Chocolate Hill,
after the warships had bombarded it for three days.
We watched the naval guns at work, and saw the
terrible havoc they caused&mdash;many a Turk we saw
flying up in the air when the shells burst. When
we advanced over Salt Lake we had to cross a hayfield,
under a very heavy fire. The bursting shrapnel
knocked many a fellow down, and we could not stop
to help them or pick them up&mdash;and that was terribly
hard on us, for the hayfield had taken fire and it
meant that a lot of helpless men were burned alive.
I saw one poor chap, a Yeoman, struck by shrapnel.
This made him completely helpless for the time, and
the fire got at him and burnt half his left leg off;
but I am thankful to say that he managed, by a
truly desperate effort, to crawl away, and he got out
of it at the finish. We were in the advance, and as
the field was catching fire just as we got out of
it, we escaped the worst, which was to be caught
in the middle, so that even those who were fit and
could make a rush were badly burned and suffering
intensely before they could get clear of the horrible
ring of fire.</p>

<p>I can tell you of an extraordinary incident that
happened in the Chocolate Hill attack to a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the South Wales Borderers. In the second bayonet
charge he drove his steel into a Turk&mdash;and it broke.
Off he dashed without his bayonet, and rushed with
his chums to the next trench, where he plumped into
a Turk who was crawling through a hole. Knowing
that his broken bayonet was useless, he clubbed his
rifle and let the Turk have the butt. The blow smashed
the butt clean off, and the Borderer tumbled
down. The Turk, who was not much hurt, sprang
back from his hole, and jumped to his feet with the
Englishman fairly at his mercy. Luckily for the
Borderer a pal rushed up and saved him by settling
the Turk. It was an extraordinary thing that the
Borderer first broke his bayonet and then bashed
his butt, which came off as clean as a whistle.</p>

<p>Another thing that happened was this: An officer
was wounded and fell. One of the men of his regiment
heard the report that the officer was missing.
“I’ll go and find him,” he said, and off he went.
After an hour’s search he found the officer and asked
him if he could walk. “No,” the officer told him,
so the man picked him up and started to carry him&mdash;a
hard and dangerous job. While the officer was
being carried he was wounded again, a bullet striking
him. “Put me down,” he ordered, “and look after
yourself.” “No, sir,” said the man; “if you’re
game, I am.” And game he was, too, for he got him
safely away, and the officer, to show his gratitude,
made the man a present of his revolver and a silver
flask. When the soldier rejoined his regiment they
took the revolver away; but he kept the flask as a
memento, carefully wrapped up in all sorts of things,
very proud of the gift from the officer, who had said,
“I shall never forget you!” The officer was mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
wounded, and died before they could get him into
the hospital ship.</p>

<p>It was round Chocolate Hill that we made our
queerest find of all&mdash;women snipers. There was a
kind of blockhouse which had been a farmhouse, and
it had a very fine well, which had some very fine
water&mdash;a precious thing. There was a big run on the
well, and a lot of fellows were shot by snipers who
could not be traced, till a fellow in a Welsh regiment
swore that he could see some one moving in some
trees not very far away. A machine-gun was brought
up, and fifty rounds or so were fired into the trees,
which dropped some very rare fruit&mdash;four men Turks
and one woman Turk, all snipers. When we went
up we found that they were almost naked, and had
their faces and hands and bodies and rifles painted
green to match the trees. And there they roosted,
like evil birds, potting at our chaps whenever they
got the chance, which was pretty often. This was
such a good haul that firing was directed on all the
trees, and more snipers were brought down, including
several women. Some of the women wore trousers,
like the men, and some had a kind of full grey-coloured
skirt. They were as thin as rats, and looked
as if they had had nothing to eat for months. I
think there were six or seven women snipers caught
in the trees, and it is said that the Turks have women
in the trenches; but I don’t know if that is true. I
saw one woman sniper who had been caught by the
New Zealanders. I don’t know what was done with
her; but as the men came back they told us they
had bagged her in a dug-out, where she had a machine-gun
and a rifle, and that she seemed to have been
doing a very good business in sniping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Dysentery knocked me out in the end, and after
spending a fortnight in hospital at Malta I had
“H.S.B.”&mdash;hospital-ship berth&mdash;put opposite to my
name. I came home in a hospital ship, a foreigner,
which made me thankful when I landed at Southampton
and entered a good old English hospital
train bound for Manchester.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pcn">AN ANZAC’S ADVENTURES</p>

<p class="ppchb">[“When the German blood-stained Eagle and its vulture-hearted Chief</p>
<p class="ppch">Made war on little Belgium, they held the fond belief</p>
<p class="ppch">The British Lion had grown too tame and dared not interfere;</p>
<p class="ppch">But when old England called the roll, Australia answered, ‘Here!’”</p>

<p class="pch">That is part of one of the marching songs of the Anzacs, and
it will go down to history as surely as “John Brown’s Body”
has descended to our own generation. It was written for a
particular Australian battalion, but it applies to all the glorious
regiments that have won immortality in Gallipoli. This
Anzac’s story shows how the sons of the Empire rallied to the
call of the Motherland, and helped so much to carry out that
unexampled undertaking in the Dardanelles of which our
descendants alone can be the fairest judges. The narrator is
Trooper Rupert Henderson, of the 6th Australian Light Horse.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I was</span> a sheep overseer when I joined the Australian
Light Horse. Before that I was a jackaroo on a
twenty-thousand acre station. What is a jackaroo?
Well, a cross between a kangaroo and a wallaroo,
and applied to a man, it means that he does anything
that comes along. My boss’s station was
twenty-five miles from the nearest town; but that’s
nothing of a distance in Australia, and we used to
have some merry parties when we had a day off,
and drove or rode to the town for a change. And it
was to the town that we swarmed just after the war
broke out&mdash;bosses and men, rich and poor. A fine
young fellow, a squatter’s son, Mr. David McCulloch,
wrote and asked me to join the Light Horse, and I
gladly did. He tried hard to come, too, but the
doctor would not pass him, and to his intense disappointment
he was rejected. He came to see me twice
while I was training, and both times he tried to pass;
but could not get through. That was the spirit which
was shown when the call came out to us to go and
fight the Germans and the Turks, or anybody else
that British troops were up against.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>We went into camp at Rosebery Park, Sydney,
which is a racecourse. The 1st Light Horse had
to sleep in the stables; but we were comfortably
camped. The hard floors of the stables were very
different from the comfortable beds which had been
left; but the fellows were mostly horsemen from the
country and didn’t mind, because they were used
to roughing it.</p>

<p>Horses, saddles, equipment and uniforms were
issued to us, and we were soon doing horse and foot
drill. After six weeks of this training we went to
Holdsworthy, on the George’s River, in the bush
country. Snakes of all sorts swarm there&mdash;tiger
snakes, black snakes, copperheads and deaf adders,
all poisonous, as well as the carpet snakes, which are
sometimes twenty feet long. They are gorgeous
things, and look like bright-coloured carpets. They
are non-poisonous, and our chaps let them coil round
their necks and do all sorts of things. At this place
there was the German internment camp, and already
there were plenty of both military and civilian
prisoners. The camp was not cleared&mdash;it was just
barbed wire for a guard camp&mdash;but the country
round it was being cleared.</p>

<p>We were very lucky in our training, and afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
too, because we were under Colonel Cox&mdash;“Fighting
Charlie,” we called him&mdash;who had seen
service in South Africa, and was a fine soldier.</p>

<p>It was midsummer and harvest-time when, on
December 17th, we left Holdsworthy for Sydney, and
we had the remarkable experience of going through
three summers in one year. We started with our
own, which we left in the tropics, when we got to
Egypt it was the Egyptian summer, and when we
landed at the Dardanelles it was the Gallipoli summer.</p>

<p>In Australia, of course, everything had given place
to the war, and army lorries and so on had cut the
roads up frightfully. They were full of ruts and
holes and deep in dust; but luckily a storm came on,
and the rain made it possible for us to travel in
comfort.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that march to the transport to
embark. We marched in the night-time, but all
along the route the people were waiting for us. Nobody
seemed to have gone to bed, and as we marched
along they cheered us and wished us luck. The
people gave us drinks, and fruit, and handkerchiefs,
and other souvenirs. It was a wonderful and moving
sight, and the people kept it up right away to the
Woolloomooloo Wharf at Sydney, where we embarked
on board the White Star liner <i>Suevic</i>. We lay in
harbour from Sunday morning till Monday afternoon.
I was on guard all the time. We had plenty of
visitors, some of them trying to get chaps out for a
last spell ashore; but that had to be stopped, of
course, and the officers sent the men down to stables.
The horses of my squadron, C, were below; but
the other squadrons had their horses on deck.</p>

<p>I am not going to dwell on the last parting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
send-off. We steamed away, and on Christmas Day
we were six days out and two days’ sail from Albany,
Western Australia. When we got there we picked up
a magnificent fleet of sixteen transports and the
Australian submarine AE2, which was afterwards
lost. Then the war seemed to be really with us, the
Anzacs, the famous word which is formed of the
initials of the words “Australian and New Zealand
Army Corps.”</p>

<p>We came through Suez and Port Said, and did not
go off the boats till we got to Alexandria. We stayed
a night at Ismailia, and there, as the beginning of our
fighting with the Turks, we came under their fire,
or rather, we heard it. This made us feel that we
were getting into things, and we listened with immense
interest to the boom of the guns. At the same time
we piled up our ship with bales of hay, as a protection,
and mounted machine-guns, and fervently hoped
that the Turks would come on and give us a chance
against them; but we were not molested. They did
not interfere with us then, but we soon had plenty
to do with them.</p>

<p>It was March 31st when C Squadron disembarked
at Alexandria and got into the train, with Major
White in charge. We went to Cairo, and then unloaded
our horses and took them, walking, to a place
ten miles outside the city; and there, practically in
the desert, we camped, and for three months we had
steady mounted drill, which made us as fit as fiddles.
We had real dry heat, and no rain, all the time; but
this did not trouble us, being Australians, and used
to droughts. But we were glad when, at the end of
the three months, the order came for us to pack up
our kits and leave for the Dardanelles. We had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
infantry kit served out to us, and in the middle of
May we were back in Cairo, where we saw a lot of
our chaps who had come back wounded from the
Dardanelles. We found ourselves once more at
Alexandria; and then, in two days we were at the
Dardanelles, of which we had heard and talked so
much, and where we had been so eager to go.</p>

<p>We had left Egypt on a peaceful Sunday afternoon;
now we were in the very thick of a wonderful
and exciting war, for we were being towed ashore
in pinnaces, each holding about 250 men&mdash;half the
regiment&mdash;and were under heavy fire. Gunboats
were booming away, shells were bursting, and aeroplanes
were sweeping about the sky. All these
things gave us a good idea of what was going on.</p>

<p>How did we take it, not being used to the business?
Well, the chaps sat in the pinnaces and looked
at one another, to see how they stood it. We were
landing in broad daylight, the boats were packed,
bullets were dropping all around us, sending nasty
little spits of water up; and bullets from rifles and
machine-guns were whizzing over our heads. I was
watching the impression it was having on the others.
Some of our chaps were wearing war medals, and I
made up my mind to carry on as they were doing.
If they took it all right, so would I.</p>

<p>They <i>did</i> take it all right.</p>

<p>As the bullets dropped round us I heard such
remarks as, “By Jove! If that hit a fellow it would
hurt him!” Then men would laugh.</p>

<p>Our colonel&mdash;I was sitting near him in the pinnace&mdash;looked
stern and calm. He knew better than most
of us what it meant.</p>

<p>We were lucky in our landing, for we had no casualties;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
but a lot of the other troops who were landing
at the same time and in the same way were picked off.
We lay off till one of the naval boats got alongside.
We all tumbled into her and were taken to the beach
for landing.</p>

<p>The Turks saw us landing and gave us five shells,
but these did not hurt anybody. We were told to
hurry up; but we didn’t need telling to do that,
and as soon as the boat was at the shore we hopped
on to a little wharf and found ourselves in the thick
of some Indians who were unloading sheep. So
little did we need telling to hurry up, that I well
remember how we rushed through the sheep in our
eagerness to get to shelter.</p>

<p>We were in fine spirits and made the best of it;
but as soon as we landed we realised what we were
in for. A shell came and burst amongst a fatigue
party, knocking the men about badly and wounding
half a dozen, but luckily not killing anybody. This
showed us how necessary it was to take cover, and
when we had got some distance up the heights and
were ordered to dig in, we set to work with a will,
and we readily obeyed the order to keep our heads well
down, as the shrapnel was bursting over the top of us.</p>

<p>Our regiment was keeping well together. The
colonel was in a gulley just below me when a shell
burst over us. It seemed to be high, and we did not
realise the danger of such explosions. This shell
seemed to be harmless; but I soon discovered that
a fragment or bullet of it had struck the colonel in
the leg. As this was the headquarters the doctor
was handy, and he attended to the colonel straight
away, and sent him to the beach on a stretcher.
Two minutes afterwards, one of the squadron clerks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
got shot with a shrapnel bullet. This also happened
near me, and I saw what happened to him. The
bullet struck him just by the right temple&mdash;he had
the closest possible shave of instant death&mdash;and
carried the eye away. This chap was put out of
action at once, and was sent on to Malta. About ten
days later he wrote to us saying what rotten luck
he had had. But he was a cheerful soul and made
the best of things, though he said, very truly, “I
have only had a one-eyed view of Malta!”</p>

<p>We got dug in. There were holes in front of us, about
four feet deep, with head covering, about two feet of
earth, on top of us; but these did not give much protection
from shells that burst just overhead. Some
of the men filled empty biscuit-tins with earth and
put them alongside to protect their legs from stray
and spent bullets, and these proved very useful.
When we had dug in we were ordered to eat our iron-rations
for tea; then, about eight o’clock, they called
the regiment to fall in, as the Turks were going to
attack us. We stood up as reinforcements at a place
called Shrapnel Gulley&mdash;and well it deserved its name,
as we soon learned, for there were a terrible lot of
casualties there, especially amongst the fatigue parties
which had to go to the beach for water.</p>

<p>You will see that we were initiated straight away.
We did not know the danger of it at the time, and
never thought that we should be so soon put through
it after landing. But it was astonishing to see how
well the chaps settled down to the business. We
had been landed only a few hours, and yet we were
standing to arms, waiting for the Turks to come on.
We expected them with a rush, for we had been told
that Enver Bey, the Minister of War, had ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that the Anzacs were to be thrown into the sea.
Well, we didn’t mean to be thrown.</p>

<p>We were standing on open ground. There were
two very high hills, and we were in the gulley at the
bottom. Some of our troops were dug in on the top
of the hills, and the Turks were dug in in front of us,
some of them being not more than fifty yards away.</p>

<p>It was a pitch-dark night, and a nerve-racking job
waiting for the promised onslaught. Time passed
and it seemed as if the Turks would never come;
but at three in the morning they let themselves loose.</p>

<p>The word was passed along&mdash;“The enemy is advancing
in front!” and we were all ordered to stand
fast till two blasts of the whistle had been sounded.</p>

<p>It was hard to make out anything in that inky
blackness, even with the eyes of bushmen; but we
knew that the Turks had crawled out of their trenches
and that they were going to throw themselves upon
us. Then two shrill blasts struck the still night, and
instantly there was a fearful commotion, for the Turks
hopped up from the ground and charged, yelling and
firing, and making all sorts of deafening noises,
amongst which we noticed a trumpeter doing his best
to blow our own call of the “Officers’ Mess.” They
seemed to blow anything that came along, so as to
confuse us in the pitch darkness. And a startling
business it was, too, to peer into the blackness and
see the figures of the Turks by the light of the bursting
shells and crackling rifles.</p>

<p>Never while I live shall I forget that fight in the
first night we were ashore in Gallipoli. We did our
best to see what was going on by looking through
the pot-holes in the sandbags of the trenches, though
at night you could look over the tops of the parapets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
but it was little enough that we could make out in
the darkness.</p>

<p>We had our magazines loaded and our bayonets
fixed. The infantry alongside were in “possies,”
as we called them, holes dug in the trenches to keep
a man from being exposed. Two men were in each
“possy,” one firing and the other loading for him,
so that a constant fire was kept up. One of our
fellows, terribly excited, had crawled up on to the sandbags,
and there he stood, just seen in the darkness
by the flashes of fire, for about ten minutes, when he
was ordered down.</p>

<p>At this time I was a non-combatant, one of the
stretcher-bearers, and I was just standing, waiting
for somebody to get hit; so I could see everything
that was going on. The shells were flying round all
the time, making a fearful noise, and an Indian
battery above us was doing good work. In a
“possy” high above us were the machine-guns, and
we could see even in the darkness what havoc they
were causing amongst the enemy.</p>

<p>In the loud cries that arose I heard a Scotchman
of our regiment shout, “Here comes a big Turk with
a brick in his hand!”</p>

<p>We peered into the blackness and saw a big fine
Turk crawling on the ground about five yards away,
holding in his hand something that looked like a
brick. The machine-guns got him just as he jumped
up. The bullets fairly smothered him, and he dropped
like a thousand of bricks. Later on I had a good
look at him, and found that the thing he carried was
not a brick but a bomb. He had no boots on, but his
feet were wrapped in cloth, so that he made no sound.
He had managed to get within ten paces of us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The din quietened down as daylight came, which
was about five o’clock. We looked eagerly around
us to see what had been done, and noticed the dead
Turks everywhere, many of them in clusters of half
a dozen, just as they had been mown down by our
machine-guns. Later on we learned that the number
of the Turkish dead was 2000, so that the ground
was fairly strewn with bodies.</p>

<p>We were ordered back to our trenches, where we
had breakfast and a bit of rest; but at ten o’clock
we were told to fall in again, as the Turks were
making another charge. The enemy did come on,
but rather half-heartedly, and they were repulsed
without our aid. They had made a fine and brave
dash in the night, as we saw. They never got into
our trenches, but we were told that they had rushed
in farther round, where the New Zealanders were;
but they had been bayoneted straight away.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Turks put up a white flag
and asked for an armistice, to bury the dead.</p>

<p>A big old Turk walked towards us, and he was met
by Captain R. J. A. Massie, a famous Australian
amateur champion, an all-round athlete of splendid
physique. The Turk was blindfolded and brought
into our trenches and then taken to headquarters,
and after he had been questioned an armistice was
granted.</p>

<p>The firing ceased, and the Turks came out with
all their stretcher-bearers, and our stretcher-bearers
and diggers went out, too, and the burials went on&mdash;and
not before they were necessary, for the stenches
were awful.</p>

<p>This sad work was being done, when our artillery
observers noticed that the Turks were bringing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
guns and reinforcements from the gulley at the back
of our chaps, and we were ordered to come in.</p>

<p>That ended the armistice for the time, and the Turks
at the back were fired on and their little game stopped.
Next morning there was another armistice, for it was
absolutely necessary to get on with the burials.
The atmosphere was almost unendurable, and, even
on landing, the stench from dead mules and so on
was so horrible that it nearly made me bilious.</p>

<p>On that second morning I was able to see that a
lot of our chaps were lying between our parapet and
the Turks’ parapet. We made an exchange of bodies,
and having got our men’s identification discs, we
buried them in the small trenches, so that the fighting-places
became graves.</p>

<p>All these things that I have told about happened
within thirty hours of our landing&mdash;and the fortune
of war had sent some of the Anzacs to their last
resting-place and put others, wounded, on the list
for home. Men were sent off, their fighting careers
ended, after having been in the enemy’s country for
only a few hours.</p>

<p>We were pretty philosophical over the business. I
remember one of the men in my squadron saying,
“If your name’s on a bullet you’re going to stop it.”
Soon afterwards a four-point-seven got him.</p>

<p>The Turks used to fire like mad. It was astonishing
to see how many bullets they fired, but even at
that early stage our men, when off duty, were asleep
and taking no notice of them.</p>

<p>At this time we were opposite Lone Pine, attached
to the 4th Australian Battalion as infantry. After
the fighting we had exactly a month in the trenches,
and then relieved some infantry who had had three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
weeks of solid fighting. We were relieved and went
to a rest camp near Gaba Tepi. We had seven days
there, with a good deal of excitement one way and
another, and plenty of casualties, for we were being
called out every day.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that Achi Baba was going to fall,
and we were ordered into the firing-line as supports
for the 5th Light Horse. The 5th were going out
in front to draw the Turks’ fire and keep reinforcements
from going down to Achi Baba. Some of the
6th and 7th Light Horse were to stand by and act
as reinforcements. My troop was in the firing-line.</p>

<p>The 5th hopped out right on the beach, and ran
for Gaba Tepi under cover of the ridges. The 7th
got up on our left. We were in the middle. A
squadron of the 7th ran along under cover of the
ridge, in the same direction as the 5th. They went
a good while without drawing the fire of the Turks,
who did not seem to notice them; but fire was opened
at last.</p>

<p>Still the advance continued, more cautiously now,
our fellows crawling when they could, for shelter.
The Turks got a few lucky shells in amongst the 5th,
and the casualties began to come in.</p>

<p>There were some odd incidents.</p>

<p>Our sergeant was peering through a look-out with
a pair of glasses, his right hand being round them.
Another sergeant said, “Let’s have a peep.”</p>

<p>Our sergeant pulled his head back and straightened
himself, but still held the glasses with his hand
in front of the hole.</p>

<p>The other sergeant was just stepping up to take
the glasses, when a bullet came through the hole and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
went clean through the hand that still held the glasses,
putting our sergeant out of action. We took him
to the dressing-station, and he was not long before
he was back in the firing-line, which is more than
would have happened if the sergeant had been still
bending down and had got the bullet in his head.
He was a nice chap&mdash;a station-manager from Queensland.</p>

<p>In about two hours volunteers were asked for to
bring in wounded Colonials from the front. There
were a good many casualties by this time, and plenty
for the stretcher-bearers to do.</p>

<p>We got to two men who, we saw at once, were
very badly wounded. They were pretty well
sheltered, and it was thought better to leave them
where they were for the present, and not try to
move them. One man had his foot blown off
by shrapnel, and he was otherwise very badly
wounded. A stretcher-bearer had bound him up
roughly and put a tourniquet on to stop the bleeding;
and another chap had carried him on his back to
shelter. Several of the stretcher-bearers were killed
and wounded at this time, but I do not think that the
firing on them was deliberate.</p>

<p>The other man was a trumpeter. He was a little
chap, and we called him “Scottie,” because he had
gone out to Australia from Scotland. He was
wounded in the abdomen, and was in agony, but we
managed to relieve his suffering with half a grain of
morphia. The flies were swarming and were terribly
troublesome. I tried to keep them off with a wet
towel&mdash;I had to wet it in salt water&mdash;so that they
should not annoy him. I noticed that his boots were
torn, and I took them off. I then saw that his legs
had not been dressed&mdash;and he had been lying there
for some time. I put iodine on the wounds.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="f74" id="f74">f74</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Scottie was rather cheery, and when the padre
came up and said, “Well, how are you?” he answered,
“I’m feeling pretty good now.”</p>

<p>When the colonel went up to him, Scottie said,
“I’m going to die!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, you’re not,” said the colonel. “You’ll
get all right again. Don’t let that worry you. You’ll
soon be playing Christmas Calls for us.”</p>

<p>To that Scottie made a reply which I shall never
forget. “Yes,” he said. “I <i>shall</i> die! <i>I can
smell ut!</i>” That was his real expression, and I
suppose he meant that he could smell death.</p>

<p>Scottie wanted the colonel to take charge of some
little trinkets and things: his pay-book, and a photograph
of two children. “Give these to the wife,”
he said. Then he broke into “Annie Laurie,” and
sang a verse of it. He sang the song fairly well. It
was a good attempt for a man in the straits that he
was in.</p>

<p>At six o’clock he died, and was buried the same
night, after sundown, at the place where we were,
and that was a big cutting called Chatham’s Post,
named after one of the officers. It was a deep cutting
in the side of the hill. These two chaps were lying
there on stretchers, and it was very hard for a bullet
to hit them. Scottie was just taken to the back of
the parade at the back of Chatham’s Post, a place
called Shrapnel Green. It was a green field when we
first went, but it was soon trodden down and made
bare by gun and rifle fire. And there Scottie was
laid to rest.</p>

<p>From the burial we went back to the dressing-station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and carried the wounded trooper&mdash;Lane,
they called him&mdash;down to the beach. The padre
asked Lane if he would like a “wad,” that is a pannikin,
of tea, and Lane said he would. I helped him
to sit up, and I held the “wad” for him. He drank
the tea cheerfully, though he must have been in
awful agony. They took him along the beach. He
did not say much, but never complained. When he
did speak it was to ask, “Who’s that lying there?”
or “How is he getting on?” He was the best I saw
the whole time I was there.</p>

<p>On the way to the beach there were wire entanglements,
to stop the Turkish patrols. The stretcher-bearers
fell into the entanglements and dropped Lane;
but he never thought about himself. What he said
was, “Are <i>you</i> hurt?” I am glad to say that he is
here in England, like me, and has pretty well got
over it, though he has lost his foot. Seventeen men
were hit by the shell that knocked Lane out.</p>

<p>We settled down again to the fighting game with
the Turks, who kept us very lively, especially with a
gun that we called “Beachy Bill.” This gun played
on the beach whenever there was a sign of our movements,
and it became a common thing to say, “Beachy
Bill’s got somebody again.” That Turkish gun
caused more casualties than all the rest put together.
The monitors used to go for it, and I believe they
bombarded it out of existence more than once. A
new gun was soon at work again, but to us it was
always “Beachy Bill.” When we first got to Gallipoli
we did not know the tricks of the trade, but
everybody soon got fly, and that helped us a lot in
tackling “Beachy Bill” and lessening his bag.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to say, but I will only tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about one more thing, and that is the blowing up of
some Turks. Our trenches and those of the Turks
almost met in places, and bombs were thrown from
one to the other. That was a lively exchange of
greetings, but it didn’t lead to much. Something
more definite was wanted, and so our people began to
dig a tunnel at a very narrow junction, so as to blow
up the Turkish trenches, and make our own trench-line
straight, instead of being, as it was, twisting and
zigzag.</p>

<p>It was a real Turk hunt, and just the sort of work
that our chaps revelled in.</p>

<p>This affair, like most of our scraps, was done in the
darkness, which made it all the more thrilling. Well,
we dug and sapped and tunnelled towards the Turks,
and when everything had been got ready, powder
was packed in sandbags and fuses were put to them.
The deeper the sandbags the worse the explosion.</p>

<p>All was ready at last. The powder-bags were
packed, the fuses were lit, and then the 11th and
12th Battalions began to finish the work which the
artillery had begun. The guns had started at five
o’clock, they went on booming till nine, then there
was a fearful sound which was louder than the loudest
thunder I ever heard, accompanied by an immense
mass of red fire in the blackness of the night. I was
two hundred yards away, but the very earth on which
I stood shook and shivered with the upheaval.</p>

<p>As soon as the crash came our chaps hopped up and
rushed the shattered trenches. They found that a
big crater had been made by the explosion, and that
most of the Turks had been stiffened. Those who
were left were either bayoneted or bombed. The
Turks did not counter-attack that day. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
had enough of it. We had a good few casualties,
but it was an effort that was worth while, because
it showed that if we wanted a place we could take it,
and at any time we liked. I saw all this very clearly,
for I was going backward and forward all the time as
a stretcher-bearer.</p>

<p>The Turks gave us no chance and we gave them
none; but at the same time they did not do anything
that I would call really dirty or out of the way. A
lot of them were fine fellows physically. Some of the
Turkish diggers we got as prisoners had no fighting
gear on them at all. They were just peasants who
had been brought up to do the work.</p>

<p>At last I fell ill with dysentery and gastritis, and
came home on a huge hospital ship, with four thousand
more sick and wounded soldiers. We had a
six days’ run to Southampton, and had just under
sixty deaths on board. They were buried at sea in
batches, the biggest being eleven&mdash;and very solemn
it all was.</p>

<p>Now I have done; but I want to tell of just one
more little thing that happened here in England,
where I have been in hospital, and where people have
been so good to us.</p>

<p>It was Christmas-time, and we were having a
Sunday evening service in hospital. We were asked
what hymns we would like, and a chap spoke out and
said, “Let’s have</p>

<p class="pps6 p1">‘We plough the fields and scatter<br />
The good seed on the land.’”</p>

<p class="p1">The parson was puzzled. He hardly thought we
could, because it was Christmas-time and this was a
harvest hymn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it’s harvest-time now at home in Australia,”
the chap said.</p>

<p>So we had the good old hymn, and it took us back
to home twelve thousand miles away.</p>

<p class="pls2 p1 xlarge">·······</p>

<p class="p1">I think the Anzacs did what they set out to do.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pcn">“IMPERISHABLE GLORY” FOR THE KENSINGTONS</p>

<p class="pch">[”By your splendid attack and dogged endurance on May 9th,
you and your fallen comrades won imperishable glory for the
13th London Battalion. It was a feat of arms surpassed by
no battalion in this great war.” This was the fine tribute
paid to the 13th (Kensington) Battalion of the London Regiment
by General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding the 4th
Army Corps, after the Kensingtons had taken part in the
British advance in May between Bois Grenier and Festubert.
The battalion had already greatly distinguished itself in the
Neuve Chapelle operations and elsewhere. This story of
some of the doings of the corps at the front is told by a member
of the Kensingtons, who wishes to remain anonymous.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">The</span> main body of the Kensingtons had gone out in
October, and I left England with a draft in January,
the dead of winter. We marched up to billets in
Laventi, three miles from the firing-line. The place
was being heavily shelled by the Germans, and
amongst other buildings the church was smashed up;
but the men were lucky, and I don’t think that any
soldiers were hit there. I shall always particularly
remember that place, because it was there that I saw
for the first time a man who had been killed by the
enemy.</p>

<p>I was going along a street near an old ruined house
which was being used as a soldiers’ club, when I heard
the noise of an exploding shell. The crash was very
near, and soldiers rushed out from the ruined house
to see what had happened. They told me that the
shell had burst farther down the street, and that a
civilian had been killed. Without any loss of time
they took a door down, and using this as a stretcher
they carried the dead man away, and as I watched
them I realised that we were fairly in it, and I am
bound to say that I was very strangely moved and
deeply impressed by this little tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>We realised even more fully what it all meant when
for the first time at the front we put five rounds of
ball ammunition in the magazines and marched off
for our first spell in the trenches, between our billets
and the firing-line. We started at dusk, so that we
should reach the trenches just when it became dark.</p>

<p>There was something very solemn in going away
like that towards the enemy; yet there was, of course,
intense excitement and curiosity. It was not a very
exhilarating start, because the country was in a
very bad state, owing to the heavy January rains.
There was plenty of water in the trenches when we
reached them, and it was bitterly cold. We were
only one night in them that time, but it was a useful
breaking-in experience, and hardened us a bit for the
much longer spells, during which the cold was so intense
that the rifles were frozen as they lay on the
parapets, if care had not been taken to keep them
well oiled after firing.</p>

<p>We got some fine experience and first-rate preparation
as a nerve-steadier in carrying out the duties of
“listening patrol.” When night came we went out
of our trenches and made our way to the front of the
parapet, working in pairs. This work was both
dangerous and ticklish, for we had orders not to fire
under any circumstances, as that would have brought
the German machine-guns on us; but to use only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the bayonet in case we came across parties of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The object of the “listening patrols” was to find
out, if we could, the German working parties putting
up barbed wire entanglements and doing other things
for their own protection. One of the pair of men
would lie down on the ground and listen, and the
other would be on the alert, ready to report instantly
any suspicious noise that was noticed. If the
Germans were putting up barbed wire, it meant that
they were quite exposed and good execution could
be done amongst them by our machine-guns; on the
other hand, if the enemy heard our “listening patrols”
they would instantly open fire with machine-guns
and rifles and anything that came handy.</p>

<p>Patrol work was very trying, especially on the
intensely cold nights, when it was a hard matter to
keep awake, and the man who was lying on the ground
was almost frozen stiff.</p>

<p>This sort of work went on for several weeks&mdash;until
about March, slushing about in the trenches, and
often enough, when we went out of them at night we
would fall, in the darkness, into trenches that were
full of water. Sometimes men were in it up to the
neck, and the only way to get your clothes dry was
to let the heat of the body do it&mdash;a long business at
times, when the body had very little heat to spare.
There was no help for it, because the men who came
to grief like that could not change at all.</p>

<p>Early in March we were digging trenches on La
Bassée Road. This work occupied us for several
nights, and though we did not at the time fully
understand its meaning, we knew afterwards that the
trenches were meant for the massing of our men for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the battle of Neuve Chapelle. These were reserve
trenches, and in the open; the consequence being
that they were exposed to the German fire, and the
digging was very dangerous work. We used to get
as many as a dozen casualties in a company while
digging, and one spot became known as “Suicide
Corner,” because of the heavy losses there. Of
course, the digging was always done at night; but
digging means making a noise, and whenever the
enemy heard a noise they went for the place it came
from.</p>

<p>It was at “Suicide Corner” that I made my first
real acquaintance with the horrors of war. As usual
we had gone out to dig. We had been taken to our
allotted place by the Engineers, every other man
carrying a spade, and our rear being brought up by
four or five stretcher-bearers. It was obviously to
our interest to dig as hard as we could, to get shelter,
and we went at it with a will, being pretty well massed.</p>

<p>There was a man quite close to me, digging for all
he was worth. Suddenly he went down, and I felt
sure that he must have been shot, because the
Germans, doubtless hearing our digging, had opened
rapid fire on us. I soon found that the poor chap
had been shot through the chest, and I went to fetch
up our stretcher-bearers. They came, and a doctor
came, and the man was carried to the shelter of a
neighbouring hedge, where the doctor and the
stretcher-bearers did everything they could for him,
by the light of an officer’s electric pocket-torch; but
he had been mortally wounded in the chest, and he
died at the hedge side, in the darkness which was lit
only by the light of the torch and the flashes of
machine-guns and rifles. The poor fellow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
covered up and put on a stretcher and carried back
to the billet.</p>

<p>This was the first man I had seen killed in action,
and it made a very deep impression on me, especially
as it happened at night. That picture of the dying
soldier under the hedge, with the doctor and the
ambulance men striving by the light of the little
torch to save him, will, I think, remain in my memory
when many of the bigger happenings of the war have
faded and are almost forgotten. It is an early and a
very sorrowful impression of the days that came just
before the beginning of the furious battle of Neuve
Chapelle.</p>

<p>No one who was in those Neuve Chapelle operations
will ever forget the massing of the British forces for
the fight. The whole countryside was alive with
troops of every sort, and there was the incessant
rumble of gun-carriages, ammunition-wagons and
heavy motor-lorries, and the tramp of hosts of men
on the march. There was a great deal of inevitable
noise, but at the same time a sinister and impressive
quietness. There was the feeling in the air that
something very big was going to happen, and everybody
felt on the “edge.”</p>

<p>The Kensingtons went on in the night until we got
into some reserve trenches, which there had not been
time to finish properly. They were simply scoopings
in the ground, with the earth thrown up on each side,
a rough-and-ready sort of arrangement, affording
very little cover and with not enough room for us to
lie down&mdash;indeed, so shallow were they that when
the bombardment began in the morning we were
actually lying one on top of the other.</p>

<p>The bombardment which opened the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Neuve Chapelle began fairly early, and it is no exaggeration
to say that when the immense number of
guns began crashing it was hell let loose. The very
earth shook, and no part of the country where we
were seemed to escape from the shattering effects of
the shells of every sort which were bursting all around
us, a great many of them in the air. Some shells
fell into the reserve trenches, and many of our fellows
were hit.</p>

<p>The trenches in front of us were manned by two
fine Line regiments, and these troops were ordered to
advance towards the Germans and dig them out of
their trenches. The Linesmen had a heavy task
before them, but they began to carry it out most
gallantly, and while they did so we came in for a very
furious attack from the enemy’s batteries, because,
although they could not get at the advancing Regulars,
we were well in the zone of their fire. We suffered
severely during this bombardment, and were glad
when the order came to rush to the trenches that the
Linesmen had left and take their places.</p>

<p>To get to the trenches we had to rush over some
fields, and as we dashed along we were under a heavy
fire, which caused us serious losses, and those of us
who reached the comparative shelter of the trenches
were thankful when we were able to drop into them
and so escape from the open ground. The thing to
do was simplicity itself, and that was to get across
the open space from one lot of trenches to another.
There was no question of doing anything except
look after yourself and carry out your orders; there
was no chance of helping any one who fell&mdash;it was
forward all the time, and those who went down had
to be left where they fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Shells were bursting everywhere and the fragments
were scattered all around the battlefield, and men
were going down, killed or wounded, on every hand.
It was through this real hail of fire that we reached
the trenches which had been occupied by the two
Line battalions, and then we saw a sight that I, at
any rate, shall never forget&mdash;a spectacle, too, which
proved how terrible the struggle was and how greatly
the Regulars had suffered.</p>

<p>I talk of trenches, but no such things were left&mdash;the
German gunners had smashed them out of all
resemblance to ordinary trenches&mdash;and owing to
one of those inevitable happenings of warfare some of
our own British shells also had helped to complete
the work of destruction.</p>

<p>The trenches had been blown in on all sides, and the
barbed wire entanglements near them had been
utterly destroyed, so that what we saw was a confused
heap of ruins, or rather an area of shattered
ground in which men had been killed and buried at
the same time. The real horror of this part of the
affair was to see the brave fellows who had done their
best, and were now lying dead and shattered in the
debris.</p>

<p>I soon had a very bad experience in the trenches
that we had taken over, so to speak.</p>

<p>I and another Kensington had been allotted a
firing position, and we were doing our best with our
rifles when I suddenly became aware that my companion
had come to grief. I looked round and saw
that he was lying at the bottom of the trench&mdash;and
I made the terrible discovery that his head had been
blown completely off. I would not mention this
circumstance except by way of trying to show what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the whole of the trench warfare meant. This incident
occurred in the open trenches; but a lot of the dug-outs
were blown in with the men inside, which meant
burial alive, and I know of one case in which seven
men, so killed, were lying together, and that is only
one instance of many of the same sort in this
tremendous war.</p>

<p>When we got into the trenches that had been
occupied by the two Line regiments we were ordered
to take up a firing position, and the first thing we
did was to try and restore the parapet and to make
the trench serviceable, in case the Linesmen were
driven back. At this particular time everything
gave way to the chief business in hand, which was
to fight, and only the stretcher-bearers were allowed
to do anything for the men who fell. Here, again,
every other man carried a spade, and those who had
them had to set to work at once to put the trenches
to rights again, as far as it was possible to do so.
This work was being done very vigorously when it
had to be dropped suddenly, because the order came
that we were to advance right up into the village of
Neuve Chapelle; and so it happened that we were
rushed up just behind the spot where the Regulars
had dug themselves in. We rushed up into the
village and lay in the open, behind some ruined
buildings.</p>

<p>The Germans had arranged a counter attack, and
if this had come to anything we should have made a
dash for the trenches, which were just in front of the
village; but as it was we made for the village itself,
or what was left of the place, for by this time there
was nothing left but the ruins, and the whole region
was an absolute shambles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Before we made this rush the men of the Line
regiments began to bring in German prisoners.
These came in batches of fifteen or twenty, disarmed,
of course, so that one or two British soldiers were
enough for a batch. These prisoners looked as if
they had had a terrible time, and, indeed, they said
they had been through some dreadful experiences
owing to our artillery, and that our guns had given
them a shell for each yard of ground they held.</p>

<p>The German attack not having materialised, we
were able to retire to the trenches and make them
habitable. Before this could be done we had to get
the wounded out and bury the dead. As a rule, we
had dug a grave for each man, but now there were so
many of the killed that we had to put the bodies
side by side in long trenches, which we made just
behind the line. Quite a cemetery came into existence
there, and we did our best to make it nice and
worthy to be the resting-place of those who had given
their lives for their country.</p>

<p>There is one feature of this great war which has
been lost sight of to some extent, and that is the
tremendous call which has been made on the physical
endurance of the men, quite apart from the ceaseless
and excessive strain on the nerves and mind. I will
give one illustration on this point.</p>

<p>On the night of March 10th, during the battle of
Neuve Chapelle, the front line ran short of ammunition
and the Kensingtons were ordered to take up a
supply. First of all we had to load up with our little
lot, and, as it was impossible to carry the ammunition
in the cases, each man got a score of canvas bandoliers
across his shoulders, in addition to his own kit and
rifle, and he had to stagger along with this tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
weight, the filled bandoliers alone representing about
eighty pounds; so that with the rifle and standing kit
each man carried a burden of considerably more than
a hundredweight. That was bad enough, but matters
were made infinitely worse by the fact that we had to
go along a newly-made road, or rather track. This
road had been constructed by the Gurkhas, by the
simple plan of putting bricks down almost anyhow&mdash;there
were plenty of bricks handy from the ruined
buildings all around us; so that the road we had to
take was rather like the huge teeth of an enormous
saw, for there was no steam roller to flatten down the
surface.</p>

<p>In the darkness, under constant fire, we staggered
and stumbled along with our ammunition; but even
the biggest and strongest amongst us could not do
more than cover about a hundred yards at a time. If
a man did that he was proud and thankful, and having
got a bit of rest as best he could&mdash;and that was by
hunking up and resting on the rifle, for if a man had
really got on to the ground he would have been hard
put to it to rise again&mdash;we forged slowly ahead.</p>

<p>We had been ordered to take the ammunition into
a house that was battered, but was more whole than
the rest&mdash;it was really only a skeleton of a building&mdash;and
having reached the house we very gladly dumped
our bandoliers down in the garden. To reach the
garden was quite a simple matter&mdash;all we had to do
was to dash through a big hole in the side of the house,
made by artillery fire, and I give you my word that
we lost no time in shedding our burden of bandoliers.</p>

<p>It was a most exciting little performance from start
to finish, yet it put a terrific strain on every man who
took part in it&mdash;load yourself up with more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hundredweight of stuff and see what it feels like;
then you will partly realise what we had to go through&mdash;and
the excitement was by no means ended when
we reached the garden in the darkness, because just
as we were getting rid of the bandoliers a shell
crashed into the house next to us and smashed it to
smithereens, a lot of our chaps being fairly smothered
in the flying bricks and rubbish.</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> a night, and one that I shall never forget.</p>

<p>There seemed every prospect that we should be
fairly mopped up, and when the order came for the
N.C.O.’s to take back the men in parties we lost no
time in returning, as best we could, to the trenches.
Shelling was going on all the time, and just by way
of giving a finish to the performance something like
thirty star-shells burst together, making the dark
night as light as day and giving the Germans a chance
to plump more shells into us as we got back. This
hurrying up with ammunition to the firing-line is
only one of many such things that have been done as
part of the day’s work by British soldiers at the
front.</p>

<p>About two nights afterwards these two Line
battalions of which I speak were relieved, and we took
over their trenches. There were no dug-outs, or any
such protections; the trenches were simply breastworks,
and we had a very bad time when the wet
weather set in, as it did.</p>

<p>When we took the trenches over they were in an
unfinished state, and we set to work at once to complete
them. One night, or rather about two o’clock
in the morning, I was working on the top of the back
parapet, with my head and shoulders showing, and
half asleep, for I was dead tired. Suddenly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Germans sent up about fifty star-shells, which burst
in the sky and made the darkness as light as day
and showed us up as clearly as possible. Instantly
the enemy opened rapid fire on our trenches and
swept us with machine-guns, the bullets whistling
over the parapets.</p>

<p>I was roused as swiftly as if the réveillé had sounded&mdash;perhaps
faster, because there are no whizzing bullets
when the bugles blow&mdash;and I well remember that I
wriggled and rolled sideways. I knew that the
darkness had become as light as daytime and that
the German fire was peppering us, and that the best
thing to do was to get out of it as rapidly as I could.
So I fell flat, then lay still, then rolled into a trench
as best I could. I remember&mdash;so soon do we get
accustomed to war&mdash;that one of our chaps growled,
“Why don’t you go a bit farther, then you could go
through an opening!” Fancy a chap picking and
choosing a landing-place when he was clearing out
from shell-fire! I knew that in rolling and falling
like this there was a risk of landing on top of a fixed
bayonet, as some of our fellows did, but I cheerfully
took that chance in my eagerness to get under cover.</p>

<p>After this we polished up our bayonet work and
went through a lot of routine, at the end of which we
were told that we were to take the offensive and that
some Regulars were to do the support work&mdash;a
proud position for Territorials. So we filed into a
front trench and relieved men who were only seventy
yards away from the Germans, so that we knew we
should not have far to rush when the real business
came to hand.</p>

<p>I wish I could tell you of what happened on the
glorious Ninth of May, when, according to all reports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the Kensingtons did so well and won so much praise
from General Rawlinson; but I cannot go into detail,
for I was hit at the start, and fell before the German
lines were reached. I know that this particular
fight began early in the morning, that it lasted all
day, and that our chaps were practically surrounded.
The order had come that we were to go for the
Germans, and I was doing my bit in carrying it out.</p>

<p>We were rushing forward when I was shot through
the chest and was knocked completely out. When
this happened I was in a trench, and our chaps were
cheering loudly, as if no such things as Germans
existed.</p>

<p>The bullet that struck me had gone through my
left lung, though I did not know this until later, and
I had had a very narrow escape; but I did not at the
time fully realise how close a call I had had.</p>

<p>After being shot I just managed to get back over
the parapet, and I was bandaged up and kept going
for the time being.</p>

<p>I felt pretty well until the alarm came that the
Germans were starting on the gas tack, and then I
wanted to be on the move. Respirators were fixed,
and every preparation was made to meet the devilish
device. For my own part, being shot and helpless,
I naturally wanted to be out of it, so I beseeched the
stretcher-bearers to carry me away, so that I should
have, at any rate, a sporting chance.</p>

<p>“Will you try and get me out?” I said; “because
I know that gas will finish me.” And being good chaps
two of them came, put me on a stretcher, and carried
me down a communication-trench and into safety,
under a constant and heavy fire, which lasted all
that famous day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been yarning long enough, though I could
say a good deal more. By way of finish I will tell
you of a little incident of sniping.</p>

<p>Sniping was going on all the time. In many places
it was very deadly, especially where the green uniform
of the snipers harmonised with the cabbages, so that
the snipers could not be seen. We got used to
the cabbage-patches whizzing bullets, but we were
puzzled by some especially dangerous firing which
came upon us from the rear. For a considerable
time we could not make this out; then we discovered
a haystack, and suspicion was aroused. We kept a
strict watch, and made particular inquiry, and were
rewarded at the end of it, by finding that what looked
like an inoffensive haystack was a place of cunning
hiding for a German marksman. This special rick
concealed in its very heart a son of the Fatherland,
who had been having a truly glorious time in potting
us. He knew that he was certain to be discovered;
but he went on sniping till we found him and put an
end to his performance. He knew that his discovery
was certain, and that discovery meant death; but he
kept his game up&mdash;and he died game.</p>

<p>This was quite fair and square fighting, for sniping
is legitimate. I cannot say as much for the German
practice, which we fully proved, of using dum-dum
bullets in their machine-guns. This they did by
taking out the bullets as ordinarily used and reversing
them.</p>

<p class="pcn">TEN MONTHS IN THE FIGHTING-LINE</p>

<p class="pch">[It is almost incredible that a man can endure a war like this
for the best part of a year without a break; yet there are many
British soldiers who have had that experience. At the outset
these were mostly the old Regular troops who for efficiency and
discipline were unrivalled in the world’s armies. The story
of one of these long-service Regulars&mdash;Private Frederick
Woods, 1st Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers&mdash;who served at
the front for ten months and was then gassed and invalided
home, is told here.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I had</span> ten months at the front with my regiment
before I was invalided home, and I think that during
that long period I saw every form of fighting except
one, and I have just been reading about it. That
exception is the use by the Germans of liquid flame,
which they sprayed on French troops some time ago
and are now sending on to the British. It is a
devilish and cowardly device, but quite in keeping
with the German method of warfare. The Germans
don’t understand the meaning of honourable fighting,
and there is no cruelty and barbarity that they have
not practised during the year of war that has ended
at the time we are talking together.</p>

<p>It is natural enough that I should take my mind
back to a year ago. How clearly I recollect that
morning when I had just finished breakfast and
opened my newspaper, and to my astonishment saw
that war had been declared and that all Reservists
were to report at once, without waiting for the
official notice from the depot.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="f94" id="f94">f94</a></p>

<p class="pc350">ROYAL IRISH FUSILIERS IN TRENCHES IN GALLIPOLI.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>I was a Reservist of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, and
had done seven years with the colours, so I at once
went to my old home. I will confess that I was a
bit downhearted, because my brother, also a Reservist,
had come home, too, and he had the pain of saying
good-bye to his wife, as well as to our parents. But
we made the best of things, and it was the better for
the two of us because we both belonged to the same
battalion.</p>

<p>How many of us who assembled at Euston Station
for the journey to our depot in County Armagh,
Ireland, are left, I wonder? Not many, there cannot
be, for the Royal Irish Fusiliers have suffered terribly
in the war. The old soldiers assembled with brave
hearts and were full of fun, and left Euston singing
“Tipperary” in fine form. I well remember how
much amused we were, when crossing in the boat,
at a man who had come from Lancashire. He was
wearing wooden clogs, and had a bottle of whisky
with him; and he sang and danced and became
particularly lively, and we thoroughly enjoyed his
performance. At the depot we found our clothes
and equipment waiting for us, and next day a big
draft of us set out for England, my brother and
myself amongst them. It was wonderful to see the
draft and realise that here were fully trained soldiers,
completely equipped, ready to take the field, and
yet only a few hours ago many of the men were in
civil life in various parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I had the strange experience of dealing with German
soldiers before we left England, for a score of us were
given ammunition and driven to Folkestone Harbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Station to meet a train of German Reservists who
were trying to get away by a boat which was lying
in the harbour, ready to take them to the Fatherland
by way of Flushing. But the German Reservists
didn’t get off, and they had a big surprise when they
saw us waiting for them. We searched them, of
course, and found that several of the men were
carrying arms. We took them to Christ’s Hospital,
the beautiful building in Surrey, and I suppose that
they are still prisoners of war in England. These
men were the usual type of Germans who were so
often seen in London&mdash;waiters, and barbers, and so on,
and I fancy that some of them were not sorry to be
just too late to join the German Army. I cannot
help thinking how different were these “reservists”
to the long-service men who had rejoined the British
colours.</p>

<p>I am not going into any details of the earlier part
of the war; but I was not long before I saw a few
more German prisoners on the other side. We had
marched two days without seeing the enemy, then
our scouts returned with three prisoners. The scouts
told us that they had banged into the Germans, who
were retreating fast, and had captured these three
fellows. I was deeply interested in the prisoners,
because they were the first German soldiers I had
seen. They struck me as being somewhat miserable
specimens, but that was perhaps because they seemed
very hungry. They looked better when we had given
them some biscuit, which of course we did at once.</p>

<p>Very soon after that I saw a farm which our
artillery had hit, and which was in ruins and full of
dead Germans. They had not had much of a chance
against the British gunners, and I noticed that along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the road leading to the farm ammunition was lying
in heaps. It was a gruesome place to billet in; but
in spite of the German dead we passed quite a comfortable
night at the farm. Next day we were on
the move again, and reached a river where a bridge
had been blown up. This delayed us till the following
morning, as our transport could not cross. But
we found a way out of that trouble by taking the
transport along a railway, and a rough, hard job it
was, too, for we needed four horses and men with
ropes to do the hauling, as the wheels kept getting
stuck between the sleepers. But in spite of all the
difficulties we got the transport across, and reached a
town which the Germans had passed through; and
we did not want telling which way they had gone,
as we could see champagne bottles and wine bottles
along the road for miles&mdash;drink which the Germans
had looted from the town.</p>

<p>Drink and outrage and destruction marked the
path of the German troops, wherever they had been,
in those early unforgettable stages of the war, just
as they did afterwards; though I believe that now,
when they know that they are outcasts from civilisation,
the Germans are disposed to mend their ways,
if only to get better treatment when the final reckoning
comes.</p>

<p>There comes into my mind as I talk the picture
of a dreadful sight I saw near Armentières. We had
reached a place and entered it, not knowing that the
Germans were so near at hand, though we knew
that we had them on the drive and that they were
going away from us as hard as they could travel.
Suddenly we came to a nunnery, where the nuns
showed us the dead body of a little French boy, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mere child about five years old. A glance was
enough to show that he had been bayoneted in the
stomach, and it was clear that the cowardly murder
had been done quite recently. One of our officers
made inquiries of some nuns, and he was told that
a drunken German soldier had killed the child. Can
you wonder that when our eyes saw such dreadful
evidence of German devilry and German cowardice,
the Royal Irish Fusiliers, at any rate, made up their
minds that whenever the chance arose the enemy
should be severely punished? Nothing has been
done by British soldiers in this war that has not been
fair and square fighting, but I am glad to think that
many a German coward and murderer has paid the
penalty of some foul crime at the point of a British
bayonet.</p>

<p>Even in the way of ordinary warfare many innocent
women and children have been killed, quite apart
from the large numbers who have been wantonly
murdered by German brutes. In one village we
passed through one of our men found a woman’s
head of hair, which had been cut off, and the body
itself was found by civilians. The woman had been
maltreated and murdered by the Germans, and on
every hand there were signs of the enemy’s ferocity
and inhumanity. Buildings were in ruins and homes
were wrecked, doors having been battered down so
that the savage soldiery could wreak their maddened
will on fellow-creatures and their belongings.</p>

<p>On every hand there was evidence of outrage. I
went to a farm in this village to try and buy some
milk and eggs. On entering a room which had a big
fireplace, I saw in the corner of the fireplace an old
man who seemed to be an idiot. A woman, whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
took to be his wife, and could speak broken English,
told me that the Uhlans had taken him away, with
his hands tied behind him.</p>

<p>“Why did they take him? What had he done?”
I asked her.</p>

<p>She answered that the man had done nothing,
but that the Germans had accused him of firing a
shot. He had not done anything of the sort, for
the shot had been fired by a French patrol; but in
spite of his declarations, protests and appeals, the
Germans beat the poor old fellow on the head with
their lances and did their best to force him into a
confession that he had fired. But he would do
nothing of the sort, and at last they let him go&mdash;they
would not have done that if they had not
known that he was perfectly innocent. He managed
to get back to his home, covered with blood and
almost senseless, and the first thing that was noticed
about him was that he had lost his memory. He
very soon became the sorry spectacle I saw in the
corner of the fireplace, an innocent man who had
had the life nearly beaten out of him and had been
maltreated into idiocy. It took me some time to
understand the real point of the Germans’ brutality&mdash;that
they had let the poor old fellow loose and told
him to run, and had battered him on the head and
prodded him with their lances because he did not
run fast enough. These are the soldiers who boast
that what they have done in Belgium and elsewhere
is nothing to what they would do in England if they
got here. And for once I believe their boast.</p>

<p>I recall the sad case of another old lady I saw.
She was crying bitterly, and when she was questioned
explained that the Germans had taken her son away&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he was never seen again. Like so many more
of the inhabitants, he had fallen a victim to German
“frightfulness.”</p>

<p>If you turn from these sad cases&mdash;and I have
mentioned only one or two that come into my mind&mdash;and
try to tell of what was done to ordinary people
because they happened to be in the war zone, words
almost fail you; but I recollect that at one time we
had been relieved by French Alpine troops and had
entrained for St. Omer, where Lord Roberts died,
while the guns were solemnly booming in battle.</p>

<p>We reached St. Omer and were resting on the
square, when a German aeroplane came over and
dropped two bombs, killing a woman and a child,
but no soldiers. As soon as it was seen that this
was happening, one of our own aeroplanes was sent
up after the German. Up he went, in glorious style,
and brought the baby-killer down; and when we
saw it we cheered for all we were worth. The German
dropped between the two firing-lines and was shot.
We tried to make him a prisoner, but every time we
made a rush to get him the Germans fired on us, not
caring in the least about the fate of their own airman.
The machine itself was shelled by us and burnt.</p>

<p>When we reached the Aisne we found that a bridge
by which we were to cross was blown up; but our
engineers soon repaired the bridge, which had not
been destroyed properly, so that it was strong enough
to carry us. Having crossed the river, three regiments
went to the tops of the hills and entrenched&mdash;the
Warwicks, the Dublin Fusiliers, and the Seaforths,
our own regiment being left in reserve at the back of
a village.</p>

<p>The French troops were on our left, in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Soissons, and we used to see their artillery galloping
across the plain with ammunition for the guns.
The French use mules and not horses for their
batteries, and once we saw some artillery galloping
in fine style under German fire. When the guns
were passing near us four shells landed amongst the
limbers, but no one was hurt, and on seeing this we
gave the Frenchmen a tremendous cheer, for luck,
and they replied with cheers and wild waving of
whips as they galloped away and nearer into the
fire zone. I remember that day well, because on
the night of it we had to go and bury thirty-five of
our artillery horses that had been killed.</p>

<p>Next day was our turn for shell fire from the
Germans. The shells landed right into us, but we
were lucky&mdash;only one man was killed though several
were wounded. We advanced up the hill, out of the
way of the fire; but as we moved the enemy gave us
shrapnel, and the shelling became so heavy that
half-way up the hill we dug ourselves in.</p>

<p>While we were going up the hill, in short rushes,
just like an ordinary field day, and without any
confusion, an artillery corporal, whose name I do
not know, showed splendid courage and uncommon
strength in carrying several of our men to a hospital
which the Germans were shelling. For his bravery
he received the French Médaille Militaire.</p>

<p>Our transport had a very rough time, for out of
fifty horses no fewer than forty-two were killed or
had to be shot. Twenty men were picked out,
myself amongst them, and sent back some distance
for new horses, and I am glad to say that we returned
safely with the animals.</p>

<p>I was then put on guard over a bridge which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a special favourite with spies. They were always
trying to get through, but in most cases they failed,
and being caught and found out, there was no waste
of time in shooting them, after trial by court martial.
After being relieved at this place by French Alpine
troops we entrained for St. Omer, the place I have
mentioned, and from St. Omer we were rushed in
French motor lorries for about sixteen miles, to a
village where we rested for the night. Next morning
we were told that the Germans were on a hill six
miles away.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that day, because it rained in
torrents, and it was a sodden regiment that trudged
through the mud and mire and swished across
drenched fields. It was not exhilarating, but we
were soon warmed up by the German fire. We
were ordered to lie down, and down we lay in a
field of swedes, so we fairly flopped into beds of mud
and water, just about completing our discomfort.</p>

<p>The rain was pattering down like tiny bullets, but
we also got a shower of the real things, and you could
hear the bullets “zip” into the leaves of the swedes.
It was intensely trying and very miserable to be in
such an exposed place, and we were glad when the
order came to fix bayonets, ready for a charge. We
fixed bayonets, but had to wait some time before
the order to charge came; then we heard the word
we wanted, and up we rose and off we went. The
firing became hotter than ever, and several of our
men were killed and wounded before the top of the
hill was reached.</p>

<p>There was not much commotion as we advanced,
but somewhere a Seaforth Highlander was playing
bagpipes, and the skirl helped the boys along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>We expected some stiff work when we reached the
top of the hill; but when we got there we were astonished
to find that the Germans had gone, taking their
wounded with them. We were after the enemy so
quickly, however, that they had to leave their
wounded, who fell into our hands, and of course
got exactly the same treatment as if they had been
British soldiers. A hundred and three of the poor
beggars had been left in a convent for the nuns to
look after, so you may be sure that they had been
well cared for before they became our prisoners.</p>

<p>The Germans at this stage were retiring rapidly,
and we kept them on the run. We soon came to a
little village, where we found that the Germans had
put sandbags in the church tower and had planted
a machine-gun in the tower. A French flag which
was flying on the tower the day before had been
dragged down by the Germans and torn to pieces.
We looked upon the flag with sadness, for here again
we had evidence of German brutalities&mdash;in their
retirement the soldiers had maltreated the women,
and they had battered down doors and smashed
windows in their savage determination to enter
houses. They accused the villagers of firing on
them&mdash;though the villagers had nothing but a few
old useless firearms, which we saw. In spite of this
they declared that a man had fired on them, and they
shot him. The body was taken away by a priest.
These things, I can assure you, roused us up properly,
and we put plenty of heart into our continued pursuit
of the Germans; but they were flying so fast that they
were very hard to catch.</p>

<p>We came up with them in the big town of Armentières,
and were so close to them that as we entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the town our scouts came back and told us that the
enemy were just leaving it at the other end. As we
entered the town we were cheered enthusiastically
by the French, who seemed to look upon us as
deliverers, and so loaded us up with gifts of chocolate
bread, matches and so on that we had to throw half
the things away.</p>

<p>Going into Armentières on the very heels of the
Germans was an exciting and dangerous performance,
and as we advanced along the streets we went on
each side, not knowing on which side shots would
come from windows, but ready for anything that
happened, as the men on one side had their rifles
handy for any German that appeared on the other.
This was a better plan than being on the look-out
for trouble from the windows just above your head.
Luckily not many shots were fired upon us at this
stage; but we soon came to a farm where one of the
most desperate little fights that I can call to mind
took place.</p>

<p>We were wary in entering the farm, for we saw at
once the sort of thing we had to tackle. There were
four Germans concealed in a cellar the window of
which was on a level with the ground, so they had
full control of the yard and the entrance-gate.</p>

<p>Some of our boys, with Captain Carbury, went in
and tried to persuade the Germans to surrender, but
their answer to the coaxing was a volley which killed
the officer and wounded the men. The captain was
terribly mutilated, for he had been struck full on
the body, not by an ordinary honest bullet, but an
explosive bullet, and the men had been badly hurt.
As they lay on the ground they cried for help, and
all the time the Germans were firing on them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
succeeded in hitting them on the legs and shoulders.
Two of our men, brave fellows, volunteered to try
and save their wounded comrades, and they dashed
into the yard, only to be shot and killed as soon as
they entered. One of these fine chaps was Lance-Corporal
Shield, but I do not know the name of the
other.</p>

<p>It was useless to waste further life in the attempt
to get the Germans out of their strong little position,
from which they could fire without making themselves
targets, so our officer sent for some engineers to
undermine the farm and blow it up. The Germans
were warned what was going to be done, and were
called upon to surrender. This they refused to do.</p>

<p>During that night the engineers were working like
moles, and I didn’t envy the feelings of the Germans
who were trapped in the cellar, nor was there any
pity for them next morning when the engineers
finished their work.</p>

<p>There was a crash and a flame and a shaking of
the ground&mdash;and when, later, things having settled,
we went to see what had happened we found one
badly damaged German hanging over an iron girder
on to which he had fallen after being blown up.
We made a prisoner of him. His three companions
had been killed, and we saw that they had been
blown to pieces.</p>

<p>The Germans by this time had received big reinforcements,
and they entrenched themselves strongly.
We entrenched as well, and a warm job it was, as
bullets used to whistle past us constantly.</p>

<p>We were in these trenches thirty-seven days before
we were relieved, and long, hard days and trying
nights they were, putting an uncommonly severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
strain on everybody. It was almost certain death
for a man to show himself, yet men had to show
themselves, because water had to be fetched and
rations had to be brought up to the trenches and
taken in. Whenever it was possible to do so advantage
was taken of the darkness; but we could not
always wait for night, and during the daytime some
splendid acts of bravery were seen.</p>

<p>I will tell of one particular instance, because the
man will be always remembered with pride by the
Royal Irish Fusiliers&mdash;his valour won for him the
Victoria Cross. This was Private Robert Morrow,
an Irishman, who literally did not know the meaning
of fear. One day we badly wanted some water, and
this was to be had only from a farm which was some
distance away. To reach the farm it was necessary
to leave the trenches and cross open ground, exposed
to the German fire, which was very deadly because
we were so near the enemy’s trenches. These were
only about 600 yards away, and not more than
300 yards away were some snipers, in a farm in front
of the trenches.</p>

<p>Morrow volunteered to fetch some water, and
taking an empty two-gallon stone rum-jar he started
on his perilous journey. As soon as he was seen
after leaving the trench the Germans did their very
best to pot him; but they missed every time, and
Morrow reached the farm, filled his jar and began
his trip back. And a hard business it was, for a jar
like that will hold about fifty pounds’ weight of
water, then there is the jar and the awkwardness of
carrying it when the carrier has to duck and dodge
over every yard of the ground. But Morrow was a
splendid hand at the game, and he actually managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to reach the trench in safety and was on the point of
dropping into it with his precious water, and we
were just ready to give him a wild Irish cheer. But
at this very moment crash came a German bullet,
and the rum-jar was smashed to pieces and the water
rained on the ground and was lost.</p>

<p>Morrow was the sort of chap who can’t be beaten.
Instantly he volunteered to go back to the farm with
water-bottles. What can you do with such a man
but let him have his way? We handed over the
water-bottles, quite a festoon of them, and having
slung them round him Morrow left the trench for
the second time and began to make his way towards
the farm.</p>

<p>As soon as he left the shelter of the trench he drew
the German fire on him, and he was under it all the
way to the farm, where he filled the bottles, and all
the way back. This time he reached the trench
safely and dropped into it, bringing the water with
him and escaping every German bullet that was
meant to kill him. He was a plucky kid and we
were proud of him. And the regiment will be proud
of him for all time&mdash;I say will be, for like quite a
number of the heroes who have won the Cross Morrow
has been killed.</p>

<p>Now that I am talking of him I recall the fact that
only the day before he was killed he went to a well
for water, and had a remarkably narrow escape from
an odd sort of death&mdash;not a soldier’s end at all. The
Germans had blown the farm to pieces, but there was
a lonely chimney-stack standing. When Morrow
went to the ruined farm a high wind was blowing,
and just as he was passing the chimney a strong gust
brought it down in a heap at his very feet. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
escaped by just a few inches from being killed and
buried in the heap of masonry.</p>

<p>It was on April 12th that Morrow actually won his
Cross. At that time we were near Messines, and the
trench warfare was being carried on with great energy
on both sides. Shell fire from the Germans was
shattering and wrecking some of our own trenches,
so much so that British troops were being buried
alive in some places.</p>

<p>Several soldiers had been knocked out by shell
fire and buried in the fallen earth. You can easily
imagine what it means&mdash;men are in a trench, which
is really a sort of vast open grave, and shell fire
shatters the earth which is around and simply buries
the men. So it happened on the 12th of April,
and Morrow saw and knew it. Just as he had
acted when he went and filled the rum-jar and our
water-bottles with water, so he acted now&mdash;he gave
no thought to himself. Out he went, not once, but
many times, into a bullet-swept zone, till he reached
the trenches which had been knocked out of shape
by German shells, and in the rubbish of which his
comrades were lying buried and helpless. He dug
them out and pulled them out, and one by one he
brought the senseless fellows into safety. That was
the deed for which Morrow got the Victoria Cross;
but in reality he had won the honour time after time.
He was killed at “Plug Street,” as we called the
place. A piece of shell struck him on the head and
he died immediately.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary things happened to some
of our fellows, and there were escapes from death or
capture so strange that you could not credit them
unless you saw them. I will mention one particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
incident that comes into my mind. I saw one of our
motor ambulances going along a road. There was
nothing unusual in that, of course, because we have
many motor ambulances and there are many roads,
but in this case the road led straight into some
German trenches. Before it was possible to do
anything or raise an alarm the driver had blundered
into the very midst of the enemy, and there he was,
with his ambulance, just about as much amazed to
see the Germans as they were to set eyes on him.
They ought, of course, to have bagged both the driver
and his vehicle; but he sprang down, restarted his
engine and began to run away. The Germans pulled
themselves together, and every man who could bring
a rifle to bear fired on the retreating ambulance; but
luckily the driver had a fair lot of protection, and
though hundreds of bullets struck the bonnet of the
car not one of them touched him, and he got safely
away and went on his journey. It was a remarkable
escape, and all who saw it were glad that the plucky
chap got so well out of the trouble which had followed
his mistake.</p>

<p>One night I was on sentry in the trenches when
the sentry next to me gave the alarm. He had no
sooner done that than he saw something crawling
over the trenches. He did not waste a second&mdash;he
lunged out with his bayonet, and then found that he
had driven it into a German’s shoulder. The German
was made a prisoner, then it was discovered that he
had lost his way in the dark and had got into our
trench. When we searched him we found that he
had a revolver and a long knife; but he was miserably
clad, his feet being wrapped up in newspapers, as he
had no socks. He said he was glad to be captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Our chaps sometimes make the same mistake&mdash;a
very easy one, as the German trenches were so close
to our own. Two of our men went, one dark night,
to get some hot tea in dixies. On their return they
got into a communication trench and lost their way;
but at last, thinking they were home again, they
shouted down a trench, “Hi, Bill, take the tea!”</p>

<p>Instantly bullets were flying around them, and
realising that they were not back home at all, but
had reached an enemy trench, they dropped the
hot tea on the Germans, then ran for it and got
safely off.</p>

<p>I had been a long time at the front before I was
detailed to go back with the transport and bring up
the officers’ rations every night. We used to gallop
as hard as we could till we came to a bridge, which
the Germans could see and did their best to smash
with shells. There was a sharp turning which a
priest had called the “Devil’s Corner,” saying it was
worse than hell because of the continual shelling.
We were forced to take this road, because it was the
only way to reach the trenches.</p>

<p>At night the Germans threw a searchlight on the
“Devil’s Corner,” and as soon as ever they saw us
appear they shelled us, sometimes as many as four
shells coming together; but we dashed on so furiously
that they could not get us, nor did they catch us
when we ran the gauntlet coming back, though they
used to get an average of a wagon a night. In
addition to this deadly corner we had three burnt
villages to tackle; but we were always lucky, and
our men did not come to grief.</p>

<p>We used to go right up to the trenches, only about
twenty-five yards from them, with the horses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wagons, and there was one specially dangerous spot
which had to be passed. This was where there was
a gap in a hedge, which the Germans knew of quite
well and could see. They knew that at night our
troops went to the gap to get water, and so in the
daytime they trained machine-guns on the spot, and
when darkness came they blazed away in the hope
of wiping some of our men out. I have known these
guns whirr for five minutes without a break, sending
out a fire so horrible that nothing could live under
it. We lost several men at this gap, and were forced
to make an opening in the hedge somewhere else.</p>

<p>We got into reserve trenches, and here it was that
a “whistling Willy,” which is our nickname for a
small German shell, went clean through a Seaforth
and then killed one of our own men in the trenches.
The shell passed through the Highlander intact, and
did not explode until it reached the trenches, a
circumstance which shows the amazing performances
of projectiles in this war. You never know what
they will do. At another time one of our chaps,
named Steel, was having his hair cut, when a shell
exploded near him and a piece of it, six inches long,
like a needle, struck him through the heart and killed
him on the spot.</p>

<p>The winter was a very rough time for us, as we
could not keep the water out of the trenches, and
we often had to sleep standing up, during a four days’
spell in the trenches. Often enough, at the end of
one of these hard spells, we were intensely disappointed
because we could not be relieved, owing
to troops being moved elsewhere, and we were forced
to stick it for an extra four days; but we did not
forget to make up for it when we were out, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
we had to march a few miles to our billets to rest,
and even then we were not free from shell fire.</p>

<p>By the time I had been at the front seven months
I think I had seen almost every phase of this tremendous
war; but I had yet a lot to learn of what
the war means, and I began to learn afresh when we
got to Ypres and later on had a dose of poison-gas.</p>

<p>None of the sights I had seen were to be compared
with what we witnessed in the famous and beautiful
old city, which the enemy had reduced to ruins.
They had used shells of every sort, and I saw many
evidences of the havoc and death that had been
brought about on innocent people.</p>

<p>There was one house, on the left-hand side of the
Museum, the home of a poor-class person, which was
in ruins. I noticed this specially, as many of us did,
because from the ruins there peeped some tiny feet&mdash;one
of the most pitiful sights I ever saw. We made
inquiry and found that a gas-shell had come, shattered
the house, and killed and buried in the wreckage
the father and mother and three children&mdash;a whole
family of five, and it was the little feet of the smallest
child that we saw amongst the debris. There was
nothing for us to do but march on, and become more
grimly determined than ever to fight and smash the
enemy who had done these things. In cases like
these we cannot stop to do anything; but there is
the comfort of knowing that our fatigue parties will
come up and give decent burial, and that the service
will be conducted by a priest of the same faith as
the slaughtered victims.</p>

<p>It was on April 26th that the gassing by the
Germans began, and we had a repetition of the
diabolical business on the 27th and 28th. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
quite taken aback by this development in the warfare,
and as we were not prepared for it, not having
even respirators, we suffered terribly. The men who
got a full dose of the poison died an awful death,
turning black in the face and foaming at the mouth,
the buttons on our tunics turning rank green; while
those who were only half-gassed reeled about like
drunken men. I was lucky enough to be amongst
the only partially gassed, but what with that and
my ten months at the front I was pretty well worn
out and was invalided home.</p>

<p>I have said that I have seen every form of fighting
except one&mdash;the liquid fire. I have certainly been
under every sort of fire but that, and I don’t think I
am saying anything unsoldierly in admitting that the
fire I love best is the fire we left behind in dear old
England.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pcn">A GUNNER AT THE DARDANELLES</p>

<p class="pch">[”Next I come to the Royal Artillery. By their constant
vigilance, by their quick grasp of the key to every emergency,
by their thundering good shooting, by hundreds of deeds of
daring, they have earned the unstinted admiration of all their
comrade services.” That is the tribute which General Sir
Ian Hamilton paid to the gunners in his despatch describing
the operations in the Gallipoli Peninsula&mdash;a document which
is the story of a noble failure. Little has been told of the
doings of the artillery, but we can realise what they did from
this narrative of Gunner John Evans, 92nd Battery, Royal
Field Artillery, who was included in the vast number of soldiers
who were invalided home through sickness.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I was</span> in India with my battery when the war broke
out. I had been in the country for seven years, and
much as I liked it&mdash;I thoroughly enjoyed my soldiering
there&mdash;I wanted to be off to the front. But I was
kept in India for six months, training men to fight
the Germans, and so doing my bit in that way.
Then I came to England, where my battery had a
splendid time because the people were so kind; and
after that very pleasant change I was off to the
Dardanelles, and went right into a fair hell of fighting.
You can imagine a lot as a soldier, but no flight of
fancy would ever have made you picture in your mind
the things that actually happened. It is all over
now, and some of us in hospital have time to think
of the brave fellows who are resting in the Peninsula.
They could not do what they were set to do, because
that was beyond the power of ordinary man; but
they did more, I think, than any other troops in the
world could have done. To any man who knows
what the country and climate are like, and who saw
the difficulties and endured the awful discomforts,
it seems that almost miracles were performed; and
of all the wonderful things none was more wonderful
than the withdrawal from Gallipoli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>We went straight into the business. There was
no beating about the bush over the job. We got
there, to the famous Lancashire Landing at W
Beach, and my battery was the first to land on
Turkish soil. Looking back on the campaign makes
you wonder that we ever got either in or out of
Gallipoli.</p>

<p>When our transport got near enough for us to begin
our landing operations we were treated to a fine view
of the desperate fighting that was going on, to say
nothing of being under fire ourselves from the Turkish
guns, a proper preparation for the regular hell of fire
that we were under when we actually landed ourselves.</p>

<p>The Turks had opened fire on our transport from
the Asiatic side as well as the European side, and
what was happening to our own ship was happening
to a whole fleet of transports and all sorts of other
ships. There were warships bombarding the enemy’s
position, and the din altogether was enough to
stagger even a long-service gunner who thought he
knew what noise meant.</p>

<p>This happened about half past ten in the morning.
At that time the Lancashire Fusiliers were making
their magnificent attempt to land, and I shall never
forget their pluck and the way they stuck to their
deadly job. They were being conveyed ashore in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
lighters, and the Turks&mdash;we could distinctly see them
over the edge of the cliff, not a hundred yards from
the foreshore&mdash;were pouring in a terrible fire at close
range. Shells, too, were dropping from the batteries
at Achi Baba, miles in the rear, with wonderful
precision.</p>

<p>The Fusiliers’ lighters could not get close to the
beach owing to the barbed wire entanglements which
had been fixed in the water, so the men were ordered to
get out and wade ashore. This they began to do&mdash;and
it was one of the most awful jobs that a landing
party ever undertook.</p>

<p>I could see them quite well from our transport.
Without a moment’s hesitation the Lancashires
clambered over the sides of the lighters and into the
water they went, struggling to get ashore. It is hard
enough to force your way through water at any time;
put to that difficulty a heavy kit and rifle and ammunition,
throw diabolical barbed wire in, and you will
understand to some extent what it all meant.</p>

<p>As these brave fellows threw themselves overboard
dozens of them were shot; a lot more were caught by
the barbed wire, and as they were held helplessly,
with flesh and clothing torn in their frantic efforts to
get free, they were killed or wounded by the Turkish
fire.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for any of the Fusiliers to
survive and get ashore, yet many forced their way
through everything and landed on the beach, where
they at once formed up roughly, and then without
the slightest hesitation they charged up the face of
the cliff, which looked to me almost as hard to scale
as the side of a house.</p>

<p>As they scrambled up the cliff they were met by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
more murderous fire than ever from rifles and machine-guns,
and numbers were killed or wounded. It seemed
to me that for every man who reached the top at
least four were killed or maimed. I could see the
bodies rolling down the cliff-side on to the beach.</p>

<p>It was only a little band of Lancashire Fusiliers
that managed to scramble and rush to the top of
that terrific cliff&mdash;a few hundreds or so. They must
have been exhausted; but their blood was fairly up,
and with fixed bayonets they charged with such fury
and success that the Turks were fairly taken aback,
and I could see them giving way before our boys’
cold steel.</p>

<p>Some of the Turks were throwing up their arms,
and I could hear their shrill appeals for mercy; but
the Fusiliers hadn’t too much time to listen after the
awful experience they had just gone through.</p>

<p>After they had been driven off the Turks made a
counter-attack, and the Fusiliers, being a mere
handful, were forced back to the very edge of the cliff
and seemed in peril of going down it; but even then
they re-formed and again rushed on the Turks with
the bayonet and scattered them. Back again the
Lancashires were driven, only to recover in the most
amazing way and charge with the bayonet for the
third time. And this seemed to settle the Turks, who
cleared off.</p>

<p>While this thrilling fighting was going on, a sight
that can never be forgotten by those who saw it, our
brigade was getting ready to disembark. The
infantry had had a hard enough business to get
ashore; but ours was naturally a lot worse, for we
had to tackle our guns and horses, as well as look after
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>There were lighters alongside the transport, and
into each of these we got two guns and eight horses,
not easy work at any time, but hard now, with such a
rush on and shells dropping all around us. Some of
the explosions caused havoc amongst the horses, and
several shells dropped near our lighter; but I am
thankful to say that they were not near enough to do
us much damage.</p>

<p>We were towed as near to the shore as we could get,
and then we began the uncommonly hard and long
job of getting the guns and horses ashore. The
lighters were bobbing up and down and “ranging,”
owing to the run of the sea, and this unsteadiness
made it very difficult to get the guns and horses overboard;
but every officer and man worked with a will,
and we did it. We got them out of the lighter and
on to a strange kind of roadway that had been made
in the water by putting sandbags tightly down.
These sandbags “gave” a fair lot, of course, but we
could not have done anything without them, for the
wheels would have sunk too deeply in the wet soft
sand.</p>

<p>When a gun was ready, from ten to sixteen horses
were harnessed to it, and it took these and forty men
on the drag-ropes to get one gun over the sandbag
road on to the beach. We did our best, we strained
every nerve, we were experts at the work, yet it was
evening before the battery was ready for action.
By that time we had got the guns on the level at the
top of the cliff, about forty yards from the edge,
after tremendous efforts by horses and men. I never
saw such man-handling, even in India.</p>

<p>We had luck in the weather, for a heavy storm
came on and the rain fell in blinding sheets. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with the darkness, when it came, enabled us to take
up our position without the Turks knowing of the
fact.</p>

<p>Of course, while all this work of ours was going on
the infantry were screening us in front. A constant
and confused sort of fighting was taking place, and
our men were mixed up with the enemy in furious
hand-to-hand scraps. It was a regular bedlam, and
so that nothing should be left in the way of trouble
we were soaked to the skin. But we were so absorbed
in the fighting, and so keen to get to work ourselves,
that we did not give a thought to the drenching. We
longed to get into action, but were kept back by the
mixing up of our own men with the Turks, which
made it impossible for us to open fire, because we
should have killed as many of our own men as Turks.</p>

<p>We stood by till we knew that our infantry had
driven the Turks well back, and then it was that the
enemy got one of the biggest shocks of the day, for
we simply let go at him with shrapnel at point-blank
range. So well had we been handled by our officers
that the first hint the Turks had of our presence was
when we opened fire, and then the muzzles of our guns
were almost in amongst them.</p>

<p>During the first few minutes of that tremendous
excitement we did not bother much about the gun
drill-book&mdash;I, for instance, was loading, setting fuses,
ranging and doing any other work that came to hand.
Despite this there was nothing whatever to grumble
about in the way the guns were being served.</p>

<p>In the darkness we could not see what mischief we
were doing, but we knew perfectly well that it must
be enormous, because of the rapidity of our fire and
the goodness of our shells; and when the daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
came we had proof, for ahead of us were piles of
Turkish corpses, men who had been killed by our
shrapnel.</p>

<p>We went on firing till the Turks had been driven
back in complete disorder. We kept the game up
throughout the day, but the darkness prevented us
from following the enemy’s movements.</p>

<p>We, of course, had no observation-posts at that
time, as there were no trenches available for the
observation officers to get to know the results of our
fire.</p>

<p>After this promising start things were fairly quiet
till the small hours of the next morning, when the
enemy counter-attacked with great fury. The Turks
are rare good fighters, they knew the country, and
they had German officers driving them on in the rear,
brutes who shot them down without mercy time after
time, as I saw with my own eyes.</p>

<p>There were some native troops on our right front,
and these were so hard pressed that they were forced
to give way.</p>

<p>A staff officer who was at hand realised instantly
the serious state of the situation, as the line was
broken, and he called on some of the gunners in our
brigade to fill the gap.</p>

<p>About fifty of our men fell out at once. There
were hundreds of rifles with fixed bayonets lying on
the ground around us, and grabbing what they
wanted of these, our men rushed up and joined in
the fray, filling the gap and making good the broken
line before the Turks could understand what was
happening.</p>

<p>It was a smart little affair, and the enemy was
driven back and had to scuttle for shelter to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
trenches, where he was left for the time being, for
our troops were utterly exhausted and a rest was
necessary.</p>

<p>We were thankful for a bit of a break. It was not
for long, but we took things fairly easily till just
before midday, when another advance was ordered
against Seddul Bahr, a village of great tactical
importance some hundreds of yards away, on our
right front.</p>

<p>Our brigade was ordered to get ready for action.</p>

<p>By this time we were better off than we had been,
for we had established the necessary observation-posts,
and so we were ready for anything that might
happen.</p>

<p>At noon the order came to open fire, and we fairly
rained shells into the village&mdash;hundreds of rounds of
shrapnel&mdash;to help the infantry in their advance.</p>

<p>The Turks were just as ready as we were, and they
started a bombardment both from Achi Baba and
the Turkish forts on the Asiatic side.</p>

<p>Some of these shells were proper “duds,” and they
made us laugh. It was not necessary to be told that
they were made in Germany, for they dropped
harmlessly into the ground, without exploding; but
of course there were lots that did burst and do
mischief. Many of these dropped on to the beach
down below, killing mules and causing losses amongst
transport drivers and the men of the Army Service
Corps. Owing to the luck of war we had not many
casualties in our own battery, and the losses were
nothing like what you would have expected from such
a lot of firing from the Turkish guns.</p>

<p>But we had some sad losses, all the same.</p>

<p>Our major was amongst the few who were killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that afternoon. He was in an observation-trench
ahead, and was struck by a piece of shell which
burst just near him. The news soon spread that he
had been mortally wounded. He was most popular
with the men, and as soon as they heard what had
happened both officers and men rushed out to his
post, to do what they could for him. But you can’t
do much for a dying man.</p>

<p>The major did not last long. His last words were,
“Good luck, boys. Tell my wife I died happy.”</p>

<p>There wasn’t a dry eye amongst the men who laid
him to his last rest.</p>

<p>They say that misfortunes never come alone, and
it was all too true of us that day, for in the evening
the colonel and the adjutant were done to death
through German treachery.</p>

<p>We heard, but not till later, that a German came
along a piece of enemy trench, close to the observation-post
where the two officers were.</p>

<p>The German shouted, in quite good English, “All
officers this way!”</p>

<p>The colonel and the adjutant, who did not suspect
anything, got out on to the parapet of the trench, and
instantly a hand grenade was thrown from an enemy
trench quite close at hand. It exploded and killed
both of them.</p>

<p>That’s the sort of dirty trick which the Germans
know so well how to play. They have a born gift
for it&mdash;and that reminds me that the Germans who
were with the Turkish forces were just as dirty and
brutal in their methods as they are, by all accounts,
on the Western front.</p>

<p>Looking through a pair of field-glasses, I have seen
German officers during an attack by the Turks follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
them with revolvers in hand&mdash;your German officer
doesn’t lead, he drives, having a precious regard for
his carcase, and no earthly sense of honour&mdash;and I
have seen them shoot Turkish soldiers who have
fallen because they have been shot in the leg or have
stooped to pick up a rifle which had been dropped.
The German would be about a hundred yards in the
rear, and would run up and deliberately shoot the
prostrate man. I am talking now not from hearsay,
but of what I have seen with my own eyes, and it
does not help you to love the Germans.</p>

<p>I once saw a German prisoner, a fair specimen of
the Prussian bully&mdash;he was a lieutenant&mdash;knock down
a British sentry who had told him not to smoke in a
part of the line where lights were prohibited. It was
lucky for the bully that a British captain came along
at the moment, or the fellow would have got the full
force of the sentry’s bayonet.</p>

<p>I heard Turkish prisoners say that the German
officers treated the Turks with contempt, and it was
a marvel that the Turks had not risen and slaughtered
their so-called benefactors wholesale.</p>

<p>While on this point, I would like to say that as a
fighter the Turk is a gentleman. We would go for
them hammer and tongs in the ordinary way of
scrapping; but ten minutes after it was over we would
gladly shake hands with them&mdash;but we wouldn’t
do it with the Germans.</p>

<p>The dirty trickery that killed our colonel and our
adjutant made our brigade swear that they would
never spare the Germans when they met them in the
way of fighting.</p>

<p>It was on the third day from the landing that we
began the great advance which was meant to sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the Turks away from the Peninsula, but which failed
through lack of men and ammunition.</p>

<p>On that day we moved our guns forward about
three hundred yards, and took up a fresh position
from which we could bombard the enemy with great
advantage.</p>

<p>We were in that place for a fortnight, and during
that time the infantry had many a desperate shot
at Achi Baba, which was the Turkish stronghold.
There were many attacks and counter-attacks, without
much apparent advantage to either side; but
matters favoured the Turks, who had been strongly
reinforced and had prepared very fine defensive
positions.</p>

<p>While we were here our brigade lost a fair number
of men; but of course the infantry suffered far
more.</p>

<p>I am proud to say that our battery was the nearest
to the Turks, and was constantly in action.</p>

<p>One night we had a report that the enemy was
going to attack us in great force, and on the strength
of the report we had to retire to a safer position.
We withdrew, not without a lot of grousing among
the boys, and when we reached our new point we
were heavily bombarded; but no infantry attack
followed, as we had been led to expect.</p>

<p>There was a good deal more grousing next morning
when we moved forward again, because the Turks
began to shell us heavily as we went along the road.
This showed how well informed they were as to our
movements even since the previous evening; but
luckily our losses amounted to only two or three
horses.</p>

<p>The next day the great retirement of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
forces began, and the whole of our infantry fell back
about two miles to a point which we had nicknamed
Clapham Junction, because the two main roads in
the Peninsula join there. The artillery did not retire,
being supported on the right and in the rear by
French troops and the heavy guns.</p>

<p>Everybody knows now that if there had been
enough men and ammunition our infantry, instead of
retiring, would have taken Achi Baba and driven the
Turks out of the Peninsula. Let us hope that if we
did not manage to do that, our tremendous losses
were not in vain, and helped to spoil any plans for
marching on Egypt and India.</p>

<p>Early in June we started business again with the
Turks, and that was when the great battle of Krithia
took place. This fight lasted two days, but we did
not make much headway, as the enemy had got big
reinforcements and had prepared a defensive position
of enormous strength.</p>

<p>I had several narrow escapes from death during
that great fight.</p>

<p>During a lull I was standing behind a bank with
two or three other men, watching the enemy’s
artillery shelling a water-cart some distance away.
The cart was going along a road, and we were wondering
whether it would get clear or be blown up. While
I was doing that, a shell burst right over us, making a
horrible noise and peppering the air with pieces of
shrapnel. I ducked my head instinctively, and so
kept it on my shoulders. It was lucky for me that
I did this, or I should have been killed, because the
shell burst very low, so low that I got several shrapnel
bullets through the back of my helmet, and the
man nearest to me was seriously wounded by flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bits of metal. The third man received a good shaking
up, but was otherwise unhurt.</p>

<p>A day or two later I had an even narrower shave
with death&mdash;one of those extraordinary bits of luck
that are so common in a war like this, that you take
them almost as a matter of course.</p>

<p>I wanted to be as comfortable as possible, and so I
had started to make a dug-out for myself. I was
under fire, but I did not pay much attention to that.
I soon found that the ground I was working on was
in a bad and insanitary state, so I gave up the job,
and took myself off and began to try my luck at a
place about fifty yards away.</p>

<p>I had just got to work on the new pitch when a
huge high explosive shell dropped plump on the
ground where I had been digging. It burst with
tremendous force, and I was pelted with flying clods
of earth and got a proper good shaking; but beyond
that I was not hurt. But my first pitch was simply
shattered, and if I had not cleared out I should have
been blown to fragments, as I have seen many a fine
chap blown in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>One of the very worst of my experiences was one
day when I went to visit a chum who was on duty at
the beach. I called at his dug-out, just as you might
call for a chap at his home, and out he came, smiling,
walking up to me to shake hands.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a shell of the enemy dropped
short.</p>

<p>I was struck dumb with the shock. When I
regained myself I looked for my chum, and a terrible
sight met my gaze, for there he lay in little pieces.</p>

<p>I felt right cut up, as I had soldiered with him for
years in India, and I was going to visit his home if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had the luck to get through together. So you see
we were so near but yet so far in a few seconds, and
I am one of the lucky ones to be here to tell the tale.
Out of the whole of the officers and men who came
from India in my splendid battery, you could almost
count those who are left on the fingers of your hands.
Fighting and disease have taken nearly all of them.</p>

<p>More than once I was nearly “outed” by snipers;
but I managed to keep a whole skin. It must be
said in all fairness that the Turkish snipers were both
plucky and resourceful&mdash;snipers were brought in
who were found actually in our own lines; and once
I was astonished to see a young and pretty Turkish
girl brought in as a prisoner. She was a sniper, and
had been hanging about our lines for a fortnight.
There was no doubt that she was responsible for the
death of several good men. We were greatly interested
in this young lady, who was sent off to Tenedos.</p>

<p>These Turkish marksmen took every risk like good
sportsmen, and we made their acquaintance right at
the start, for when we were carrying out our desperate
landing snipers were actually potting us from the
beach, where they were covered with sand, so that
it was almost impossible to see them. After that we
got used to see snipers brought in who had painted
themselves green, to match the trees and foliage,
and others had decked themselves out with branches.
It was funny to see some of the beggars, and as they
had played a straight game we could not bear them
any ill will. It was the Germans who did the dirty
tricks.</p>

<p>Now for a few words on how I left the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>It was about July, when dysentery was at its worst,
and quite half my battery were sick with it, all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the same time. It came to my turn to get it, and I
was very bad for about three weeks. At last I could
stand it no longer, for I could not work without
suffering awful pain&mdash;it was like two pieces of sandpaper
rubbing together in one’s inside, with much
vomiting; so I was forced to report sick to our doctor,
who was a gentleman and a brave man. He was
very kind to me, and did all in his power for my
benefit. But it was no good. I had to go to hospital.
I thought this would be at a place a few miles away,
and I was glad at the prospect of being out of the
firing, which was awful to a degree, and to get some
quietness; but I found myself at a beach hospital,
which was composed of tents and was always under
fire. Several shells dropped in on us, causing much
damage and loss in life and material. So I was
pleased enough when I knew that I was to go on board
a hospital ship; gladder still when I knew that I was
being carried to a place which was a little safer than
Gallipoli, namely, dear old England. There was no
room for us at two ports on the way home; but I
didn’t mind that. England was quite good enough
for me.</p>

<p>We had a fine though sad voyage. It did one good
to see the smiles on the faces of the wounded. Though
they were in great pain, they were cheered with the
thought that they were leaving a hell on earth for a
turn in heaven.</p>

<p>That was the bright side of the case; the dark side
was that our engines were continually stopped while
one of our dear comrades was committed to the deep,
where he could get the rest which he had so hardly
won&mdash;but it was a godsend after what they had
suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>I can assure the friends of those who are gone, that
they were comforted in their last moments by the
chaplain and nurses, and were given proper Christian
burial as soldiers who had fought the good fight and
had fallen in glory.</p>

<p>The brave nurses were like mothers with young
children, and deserve the highest praise for what they
did for us.</p>

<p>And now, through God’s help, I am getting on all
right, and awaiting orders for the front again, to do a
bit more for King and country and to shame the
slackers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pcn">THE “FLOOD”</p>

<p class="pch">[The following extract from a letter written by Corporal
Guy Silk, 2nd Battalion Royal Fusiliers, has been very kindly
placed at my disposal. It describes a phase of life in Gallipoli
of which little or nothing has been published&mdash;the storms
and floods with which our troops had to contend in the now
abandoned operations.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I have</span> been wondering how you are getting on, and
if you have been worrying over the absence of letters.
There has only been one chance of sending a letter,
and then I sent a card in an envelope to let you know
that I was well. We have been through some terrible
experiences since I last sent a proper letter, on
November 25th.</p>

<p>On the 26th we had one more of those terrible
storms, and suddenly, as I was mopping some water
from the dug-out floor, a “tidal wave” burst in, and
I just had time to seize the Company Roll, my diary
and letters, Horlick’s Malted Milk, and my rifle and
bandolier. Then I climbed out of the dug-out, on
to the parapet! The first, or rather second time I
had done so (the first was to pick some tomatoes).</p>

<p>By this time the trenches were completely flooded,
and the whole valley was covered with water ankle-deep.
As the lightning flashed I saw a group of
fellows near me, and they joined me on my mound.
All around were similar groups. We laughed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
pretended to be enjoying it, so as to keep our spirits
up.</p>

<p>The water rose and rose, and when it was knee-deep
we started off for a piece of higher ground we
saw in the distance. We were in to the waist, and
the current was tremendous. We settled down on
this mound&mdash;the first one we saw proved to be just
a clump of weed tops. The regimental sergeant-major
joined us, but was nearly unconscious, and
suffering with ague. I laid him on my lap, and there
we stayed until daylight.</p>

<p>It was bitterly and painfully cold, and a curious
sight too, when we first saw the huge mass of water
and groups of wet men. I took the S.-M. on to
headquarters, and there he was undressed and rubbed
and wrapped in some dry blankets. Then our company
sergeant-major was brought down, quite
delirious, and Jackson and I took him on to the
clearing-station.</p>

<p>It was fine to get on to higher ground out of the
water. I reckon this walking saved me. I went
back to the company, and found the water had gone
from the ground in the valley, and the chaps were
lying in hastily constructed breastworks behind the
rear parapet.</p>

<p>The trenches were like canals, and were acting as
drains. The Turks shelled a lot. This was on
Saturday. In the evening and early morning of Sunday
it snowed and froze, and on Sunday at daybreak
we were ordered to find our way to the brigade
“dump.” At about midday we got some food and
dry clothes. It was grand, after two nights and a
day of sodden and frozen things.</p>

<p>We had a roll-call on Monday, and we were 63&mdash;on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Friday afternoon we were 600 odd. I was
made corporal&mdash;Baldion said I must be, so as to
“help to hold the fellows together,” and for a few
days was acting company S.-M.!</p>

<p>We expected to go to Alexandria, but had to stay
to drain the trenches. A big draft joined us, and
did most of the work, our feet were too sore. (I
spent one whole day rubbing feet&mdash;a savoury job,
since baths are unheard of.)</p>

<p>On the Thursday after the “Flood” (everything
dates from the “Flood” now) we went to find equipment,
and the ground was covered with bodies.</p>

<p>We are back on the Achi Baba end now, but have
not quite given up hopes of a rest, at least for the
“survivors.” I am orderly-room corporal now.
Nearly all of us are employed at headquarters, so
except for shells I am pretty safe, as we don’t have to
make advances.</p>

<p>We have had no mail since before the “Flood,”
but hope to get one soon. Please tell Aunt &mdash;&mdash; I
received and enjoyed her parcel (some was lost, buried
when the trench fell in), and explain why I haven’t
answered to thank her for it. Let every one know I
am still alive in spite of the long silence. We heard
to-night that no mail is leaving for three weeks from
to-morrow. The sketch-book has gone. I found it,
but it was “done.”</p>

<p>We had a busy time when the “Flood” had abated,
and I was continually taking my section out, digging
up rifles and equipment, and we were all able to make
up our losses in the way of shaving apparatus, knives
and forks, etc. It was hard work, as the trench
bottoms are knee-deep in mud. We wore waders.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pcn">THE BELGIANS’ FIGHT WITH GERMAN HOSTS</p>

<p class="pch">[It is hard, in language, to express the thoughts that come
to one in contemplating the achievements of the Belgian Army
at the outset of the war. Undoubtedly the coming sure defeat
of Germany is largely due to the valiant stand which was made
when the would-be all-world conquerors overran and ravaged
a little, beautiful and inoffensive neutral state. The knell of
Prussian doom was sounded first on Belgium’s battlefields.
It was believed that at the utmost Belgians could only make
a pretence of fighting; but the little army of our brave ally
defied and held at bay the braggart hosts of Germany in an
almost incredible manner. What happened in those fateful
days, which seem so far and yet in reality are so near is told
by Soldat François Rombouts, of the 8th Regiment of the
Line, Belgian Army.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I was</span> in the Belgian Army before the war broke out.
I was a conscript of the 1913 class, and went to my
regiment from the sea. For five years I had been
crossing the Atlantic in liners sailing from Antwerp&mdash;and
how beautiful it was in the summer-time on the
blue sea, with the hot sun shining; and how hard
and cold in the winter, peering into the grey gales
from the crow’s-nest! I loved the sea, and I loved
my regiment, especially when I had my rifle in my
hands and with my keen sea eyes I could make out
the Germans and use them as targets. I do not know
how many I shot&mdash;I hope and believe a big number&mdash;because
when they fall it may not be always to your
own bullet. But I saw very many of them fall before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I was wounded and had to lie in bed for sixteen weeks,
helpless, like a child.</p>

<p>Look at my right arm. Here, on the inside, a
bullet went in. If it had been an ordinary bullet,
like the one you show me&mdash;you say the cartridge was
given to you by a British Guardsman who was at
Landrecies and carried it there with him?&mdash;it would
have gone through the arm and made only a little
hole, which would soon have become well; but the
bullet was explosive. See, here at the entrance is
the small scar; but at the outside of the arm there is
this long and ragged blue mark, because the bullet
that struck me was what you call a dum-dum. Feel
the wound, it does not hurt me now. That hardness
is bone. It was carried away from the flesh and
broken, and there it has set and will remain. For
many weeks my hand was like this&mdash;a bunch, you
call it?&mdash;because I could not open it out. I was hurt
in other ways also by German fire; but I am young&mdash;only
twenty-two years&mdash;and very strong, and I may
yet again go back to the Belgian Army. If I do, and
we get into Germany&mdash;as we shall&mdash;for every Belgian
life that has been taken we shall take one German,
and more; for every Belgian home that has been
destroyed we shall burn or destroy one, and more,
and for all the innocent women and little children
and helpless old men that have been murdered we
shall make them pay in German soldiers and in
German soil.</p>

<p>I have my mother and sisters still in Belgium, where
the German beasts are; and I do not know the truth
of them. I pray that they are well; but if I learn
that they have come to harm I will never rest until
I have had my revenge in Germany. All Belgians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
will tell you the same as that. How can it be otherwise
when they have seen what I have seen&mdash;their
country run over and beaten down and taken by these
German hosts, who have swarmed over it like dirty
beasts and fouled it?</p>

<p>How well I remember that night in Antwerp when
the war broke out! It was eleven o’clock and the
church bells were ringing.</p>

<p>That was the sound of war.</p>

<p>Several days we had been out of barracks, enjoying
ourselves; but this night they would not allow
us to go out.</p>

<p>My mother and sisters and brothers came, crying.
They said, “The Germans will kill you!” But I
said, “Shut up! It will not be so. Besides, I am
a single man, and so I do not care. It is not as if
I had a wife and children.” So they were comforted,
and I made myself happy by myself.</p>

<p>We were singing and whistling and dancing all
night in barracks; then in the early morning we
marched to Brussels, and after being there two days
we were ordered to take the train to go to Liège, to
keep the Germans back, and as we went along the
people shouted, “Good Belgians! Good Belgians!”</p>

<p>We went by train to Liège, fifty miles away. We
had got the orders we were waiting for in the evening&mdash;the
orders to stop the Germans. If we could not
stop them there, we were told, they would get through.
And how true it proved!</p>

<p>We were in the train all night, singing and whistling,
and all what we can do in a train to make soldiers
happy.</p>

<p>The regiment that had gone before my own regiment
was fighting. We had gone as reinforcements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and when we got to Liège at four o’clock on that
August morning and got out of the train, fighting
was going on.</p>

<p>I saw the Germans at once&mdash;we went straight into
the street from the train and fought them.</p>

<p>We were excited, yes, but not afraid. They had
come into our little country, where they had no right
to be, and our only wish was to drive them away.</p>

<p>We rushed from the train with our loaded rifles.
I did not know Liège. It was all strange to me;
but all streets are much the same, and it was enough
that the Germans were in them and must be driven
out.</p>

<p>We fired on them, and they retired; but only a
little way and for a little while, because there were so
many of them. And in the evening they came back.</p>

<p>We fought them in the streets when they came,
and we rushed into the houses and shot them from
the windows and doorways.</p>

<p>Even now, so soon, I learned the truth of what I
had said to my weeping mother in the barracks at
Antwerp. She said, “The Germans will kill you!”
and I told her, “No. I am not afraid of anything.
The Germans cannot kill me!” And they did not&mdash;not
then, and not later, though I was shot in the right
arm with an explosive bullet and afterwards in the
right foot, of which I will tell you.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I killed any Germans at
Liège, but I hope I did. You could see them falling
over, but could not say who killed them.</p>

<p>We hated them because they had come into Belgium.</p>

<p>We were fighting all night, the rifles crackling because
of the constant firing of the magazines.</p>

<p>We chased the Germans into the fields outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Liège. We got at stragglers with the bayonet, and
we brought fifteen prisoners in. How amusing it was
when we caught them! They said, “Oh, my Belgian
brother!” We left them with contempt, and looked
after other ones. Then, when we had got them, they
were sent to the station and so to Antwerp.</p>

<p>The Germans came on in such strength that we
could not stop them; but in spite of all their guns
and regiments we held Liège for twenty-four days.
We had only 300,000 Belgians in our army, and the
Germans had about a million; but I would not run
away from fifteen Germans myself. The Belgians
called the Germans “swine,” and said, “we will be
giving the Germans one presently!”</p>

<p>And we gave them one.</p>

<p>We went into the trenches, and the Germans were
bombarding us and smashing the place up. We did
as much as we could to keep them back.</p>

<p>Houses were smashed and everybody seemed to be
killed or wounded. The shells came on top of you
and spread out like an umbrella. A lot of my friends
were killed and fell over in the trenches.</p>

<p>When we were in the trenches a man near me was
not happy, because he was married and his thoughts
were with his wife and children and home; but when
we were going on firing I said, “Look! A German
has fallen over again!” And then he was happy.
He was married and I was single, and that made
the difference.</p>

<p>If you had your friend in the trenches you did your
best for him, because you liked to take your friend
home again; but many friends were left in the
trenches.</p>

<p>Did I see General Leman, the defender and hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of Liège? Oh, yes. General Leman was a good
man. He came round and saw the soldiers and
talked to us and made us happy.</p>

<p>I do not know how many we lost in Liège. We had
a lot wounded and killed and missing; but we only
knew this from the newspapers.</p>

<p>We were on duty in the trenches for twenty-four
hours, then we were relieved. At the end of the
twenty-four days for which we held Liège we went
to Anden, ten miles away. We retired in the daytime,
without any fighting, and were in Anden about
fifteen days. We never saw the Germans there.</p>

<p>And now I became a motor cyclist, which gave
me many adventures and exciting journeys. I was
with a friend, a motor cyclist also, and we were reconnoitring
near Anden. We saw a big house, a château,
standing in its own grounds, with trees. They are
beautiful and peaceful houses, and you saw many of
them in Belgium before the war.</p>

<p>“There are some Germans here!” my friend said.
We looked and listened, and what he said was true.
There were Germans in the château, but how many
in number we did not know.</p>

<p>We hurried away to our officer and told him, and
he sent three companies of soldiers to attack the
château. How well they marched up, and how from
behind the trees and other points of shelter they fired
upon that big house in the trees, with the Germans
making themselves happy in it.</p>

<p>I and my friend had acted as guides to the companies,
and now we saw the Belgian soldiers firing
upon the château, and the surprised Germans rushing
to the windows and doors and behind the trees to
fire back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a furious fight, and it lasted for two hours.
Then we got the house&mdash;the Germans ran away, and
we took it and occupied it. But next day the Germans
came back in stronger numbers and retook the
château; and the day after that we once more got
the house and killed all the Germans. We knew
that we could not hold it long, because we had not
enough soldiers, and when we had been at the château
for about four hours, and the Germans came up
stronger than ever, we had to leave. We had not had
many losses&mdash;two or three men killed. One was shot
through the heart, and another was mortally wounded
and lived a few hours.</p>

<p>There is a river at Anden, and when we retired we
had to cross a bridge. When we had crossed the
bridge we blew it up, so that the Germans should be
delayed in pursuing us. Then, when we were retiring,
and had seen the bridge destroyed, we were made
unhappy because we saw that on the other side of
the water, which was now the German side, there was
a company of Belgian infantry, which could not cross.</p>

<p>It was terrible and sad. What was to be done?
How were our comrades to be saved, to come to us,
to be kept from capture or killing by the Germans?</p>

<p>The commander of the company was quick to think
and act. He knew that at Namur there were some
boats, three or four of them. He ordered a cyclist
to go and have the boats sent to Anden, so that the
men could cross. And the cyclist went. It seemed
so long before the boats came; but they appeared
at last, and the soldiers got into them, crowding five
and six in one small boat, and then being rowed over
the river. All the time the Germans were firing on
the company from the big hills which are there; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
we could not fire back, and all we could do was to
watch our comrades on the other side of the river,
walking about and eagerly waiting for the boats.
They tumbled into the boats and came across the
river to us, and we shouted and laughed when they
were near enough for us to get at them, and to help
them to jump on to the bank and to say defiance to
the German bullets.</p>

<p>There is a railway tunnel at Anden, and we were
ordered to go to it. We went. There is a big wood
at the tunnel, and from this wood there came a party
of Uhlans, fifteen of them, commanded by a lieutenant.</p>

<p>Three or four Belgians fired on the cavalry, who
were taken by surprise. The lieutenant was shot in
the side, next his heart, and he fell from his horse.
The soldiers went up to him to make him prisoner
of war, but he did not want to be taken, and he fired
on them with his revolver. So it was necessary for
them to shoot him, and they did.</p>

<p>When he was killed four soldiers carried him on
two rifles, one under his back and one under his legs,
to the major of the Belgian battalion, who ordered
that he should be buried. So a grave was dug and
the lieutenant was buried, and planks were put over
him, and he was left there to his rest, and we attended
to the German wounded.</p>

<p>After what happened by the railway tunnel we were
ordered to make trenches; but the Germans came up
and forced us to retire to Namur, an old city and
fortress.</p>

<p>We saw many refugees who were flying from the
Germans, who had come and stolen their land and
plundered it and overrun it like dirty beasts. There
were old men and women and children, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
pitiful to see them; yet it made us fiercer in our
fighting with the Germans.</p>

<p>Near Anden I saw a column of refugees, a little line
of about thirty-five people, and at the head of them
was a man dressed like a tourist, with a soft hat,
breeches and leggings. He was looking under trees
and all around him, as if taking care of the refugees.</p>

<p>Then, when we had seen this tourist, a boy came up
to me on a bicycle, and said, “There is a German spy!”</p>

<p>I called my corporal, and instantly we had soldiers
searching in the trees and fields and everywhere; but
we did not see another trace of the “tourist,” who
was the German spy, though we did not suspect it
when we saw him leading the refugees like a shepherd
leads his flock.</p>

<p>That was sad, to miss him so; but another spy I
got at Namur. I saw a man standing amongst the
trees, dressed in civilian clothes. He was about
fifty-nine years old and had long whiskers, such as
you see on many tourists.</p>

<p>I went up to him as he was standing by a tree. I
was alert, for I was reconnoitring and expected things
to take place.</p>

<p>Before he could understand me and be ready to
explain, I rushed at him and had him by the arms and
held them to his back. My comrades came up and
sent him with his long whiskers to the regiment. I
do not know what happened to him. I hope they
shot him.</p>

<p>I have here in my pocket an electric lamp with a
bull’s eye. It gives a fine strong light. No, this is
not what I carried in Belgium, because I exchanged
mine with an Englishman for his; but it is just the
same. And with these pocket electric lamps we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
used to search the houses for Germans that were
hiding from us. We would find them in dark corners
and cellars, and when the light was snapped on them
they would throw up their hands and cry, “Oh,
my Belgian brothers!”</p>

<p>Then we would say, “Come out of it, and we will
give you Belgian brothers!” But we always made
them prisoners, and did not kill them. It was
“Belgian brothers!” when death was on them, but
in the trenches they called us “Belgian swine” and
“little devils.” We gave them “swine” presently.</p>

<p>We had been fighting much and had been in the
trenches many days, so that we were very tired, and
thankful to get three or four days’ rest in Namur.
Then, after that blessed change, we went into the
firing again, which was shrapnel, and terrible.</p>

<p>Namur was a very strong place and was not expected
to fall; but the Germans had made long
preparations for the war, and were bombarding with
enormous guns&mdash;I saw German guns that took twenty-two
horses to draw them.</p>

<p>At Namur we lost a lot of men, because of the heavy
gun-fire. All the wounded soldiers and prisoners
of war were there; but the Germans did not care
about that&mdash;they fired on the hospital and smashed
it up. When we lost Antwerp the prisoners of war
were taken away; but when we lost Belgium we
could not keep the prisoners, and the Germans got
them back again.</p>

<p>After the battle of Namur the regiment was smashed
up, like many others. Every man was looking after
himself and trying to find his own regiment, which
was not easy.</p>

<p>Here is a photograph of Namur, showing the bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which crosses the river. I was the last man to cross
the bridge when we were forced to leave Namur;
and for two nights I was in one of these old houses
which you can see here in the picture. When I was
over the bridge I met a couple of men of my company,
and we watched some firing in the distance and
felt happy, because we knew that it was the firing
of French soldiers, who were just outside Namur.</p>

<p>We were stragglers, and I and a corporal joined
the Frenchmen. It was now that many Belgians
who were caught by the Germans were shot&mdash;yes,
in threes and fours Belgians were shot by Germans.</p>

<p>There are good Germans and bad Germans; but
more bad Germans than good ones.</p>

<p>We crossed the frontier and got into France, and
rested ourselves. I found some of my old friends
again, but not all, because a lot had been lost.</p>

<p>In France we made up the regiment again. I had
got to Le Havre, and from there I went to Ostende.
We had two days in Ostende, then I went back to
my dear Antwerp, which was before the Germans got
there. From Antwerp I went to Conte, where we
had a fortnight’s rest, after which we went to Malines.
There was not much fighting at Malines, but there had
been a lot before we got there, and the place had been
destroyed. At that time the Germans were holding
the town, but we drove them out. Afterwards we
lost it, because they came in heavy numbers, and
we could not stop the big guns.</p>

<p>We went up to Conte again about four o’clock in
the morning, and later we advanced to Termonde,
about twenty-five miles from Antwerp. Our 1st
battalion had been ordered to attack Termonde, and
the 2nd was stopping outside for reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>We saw our 1st battalion go and assault the place;
and then we saw it come back, and sad it was to see
them, because those who returned were mostly
wounded men in ambulances. There were many
wounded, as the attack had lasted three hours and
our comrades had had to cross the river under fire.</p>

<p>Then it was, when the wounded began to come
back in the ambulances, that we were ordered to go
in and push the Germans back. We had to go over
some fields, and crossing them was like walking on
rubber, because of the dead bodies. These bodies
had been taken from the trenches, when it was no
longer possible to have them there, and had been put
in the fields. Sometimes they had been in the trenches
three or four days, and we had to eat and drink and
sleep with them there. And in the fields that felt
like rubber, there were arms and legs and heads sticking
out. Ah, yes, it was horrible indeed. And this
was the war that the Germans had brought into our
little country, which had done them no wrong whatever,
and where they had no right to be. It will be
the same for them when we get into Germany!</p>

<p>In Termonde it was fierce fighting all the time I
was there, and that was for six days. And I tell you
that we Belgians did fight; for when we went into
Termonde, driving the Germans out, we saw the bodies
of women and children and old men that they had
massacred&mdash;and most of us were crying as we passed
them. The Germans can do what they like in wartime,
and these were some of the things they liked.</p>

<p>When we saw the Germans at Termonde, after
seeing those murdered women and children and old
men, we rushed at them with the bayonet, burning
to drive our steel into the monsters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>We rushed up to them in our fury, and I drove my
long bayonet at a German soldier. I struck at him
blindly, but I do not know where I hit him, because
at such a time you look after one German and then
after another, so that you shall get many of them;
but his own bayonet came at me and cut across my
right fingers. You can see the scars here&mdash;but they
are nothing.</p>

<p>It was hard and fierce work; but I was still well.
I was tired and sleepy at the end, and was almost
killed by bursting shrapnel. Pieces struck me, and
one went through my right boot and between the
toes. But that also was nothing.</p>

<p>The evening came, and it was just dark. That
was October 1st. I had been in the trenches, and was
lying down under some trees, resting. Firing was
going on still, but we were indifferent to it, and I
did not care until I was struck on the right arm by
an explosive bullet, a dum-dum. I was lying there,
bleeding, with my badly torn arm, for three-quarters
of an hour; then some of my friends came and picked
me up and gave me a drink and bandaged my arm.
At nine o’clock a doctor came along and sent me to
a church, which was being used as a hospital. There
I spent the night, waiting for the morning, when I
was to have an operation.</p>

<p>The morning came, and brought with it one of the
strange adventures of a soldier in the war.</p>

<p>I was taken on a wheeled ambulance to a part of
the church which was used as an operating-room, and
there my torn arm was treated, without pain to me.
A nun, who like her other sisters of mercy was a nurse,
had the care of me, and she was wheeling me back
to my bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There was the big entrance to the church near my
bed, and as I was being wheeled I saw in that entrance
many German soldiers, who were about to rush into
the church and seize it.</p>

<p>Quick as thought my nurse wheeled me back, and
rushed with me to a door at the back of the church,
and out into the open air. She was quite calm,
which was well for me, and she hurried me to an
English motor ambulance, which was standing at the
door and had one English soldier in.</p>

<p>The nun cried to the chauffeur, saying that the
Germans were taking the church, and telling him to
help her to push me into the ambulance.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, who was an Englishman, quickly
and calmly obeyed, and he and the nun got me inside,
on my stretcher; then the chauffeur jumped up
into his seat, and the motor ambulance tore away and
took me into Antwerp. I was in hospital in my native
city two days, when the Germans bombarded the city.
I was there during the whole of the bombardment;
then when the Germans took Antwerp my mother took
me out of hospital. There was much excitement
and commotion, and it was not a happy thing to be
wounded then; but an English ambulance came,
and I was asked if I could speak English. I said
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go to Ostende?” the man asked,
and again I said “Yes.”</p>

<p>It was a time for haste. A few minutes more, and
if I had not been able to speak English I should have
been too late, for the train into which I was put by
an English marine was the last to leave Antwerp
before the Germans entered the city.</p>

<p>Again the Germans came to where I was, and so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
had to leave Ostende. I went from there by train
to France, and from France I came to England.</p>

<p>I still stop in England. It is a good country, and
I feel safe here. It is strange to see beautiful cities
not bombarded and smashed by the Germans, and
not to see the worst of all&mdash;the murdered little
children.</p>

<p>If the Germans were in this country it would be
just the same, or worse.</p>

<p>I think much of my country, little but beautiful,
as it was; but ruined now.</p>

<p>I am young. When I am old Belgium may be as
it was before.</p>

<p>I have an eager wish, and to have it fulfilled would
make me very happy indeed&mdash;and that is to see
Belgian, English, and French soldiers march into
Germany!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pcn">A BLINDED PRISONER OF THE TURKS</p>

<p class="pch">[This is a simple, unaffected story of the doings of a young
British soldier in Gallipoli and his subsequent experiences as
a prisoner of war with the Turks. It is told by Private David
Melling, 1/8th Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers. He was a lad
when he enlisted, his eyesight was destroyed by a bullet, he
was captured on the battlefield by the Turks, and was the
first British prisoner of war to be released from Constantinople.
The narrator, when seen, was an inmate of the Blinded Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Hostel, Regent’s Park, N.W., the wonderful institution

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I enlisted</span> in the Lancashire Fusiliers in November
1914, when I was only seventeen years old, and in
June 1915 I went to Gallipoli, where we landed in
the night-time. A big ship had been run aground
there&mdash;the <i>River Clyde</i>&mdash;and pontoon bridges had
been made at the side of her, connecting with the
shore. We left our transport and got into little
steam trawlers, which were out at the Dardanelles
as mine-sweepers and so on, and these took us to the
pontoon bridges. We hurried over them, under fire,
and having got ashore we went straight into a bivouac
rest-camp. We spent five days in the camp, then we
went into the support line of trenches, which is the
second line, and after a week or two we went on
fatigue.</p>

<p>We were in a Turkish communication-trench,
digging it wider, and we came across all sorts of queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
things. We dug a dead Turk up, a chap without a
head, and near him we dug up one of our short
Lee-Enfield rifles. He had equipment on, and when
we looked into his pouches we found that he had
some of our ammunition, besides his own. We
supposed from the look of things that he had been
knocked over by a shell and buried in the rubbish.
We were throwing the earth out and making the
trench deeper when we came across the Turk’s head.
One chap got it on a shovel and fired it over the top
of the parapet. You got used to digging bodies up&mdash;it
was nothing to strike one with your pick or shovel.</p>

<p>All this experience was good for us, and got us
used to fighting before we were actually in it, because
there was firing going on all the time, and preparations
were being made for charging the Turks with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>Things began to get very warm early in August.
At about five o’clock on the afternoon of the 6th,
which was a Friday, there was a heavy bombardment
and a big advance on the left of the Peninsula&mdash;that
was Suvla Bay. According to the arrangements
we were to charge on the Saturday morning, two
hours after the bombardment began. The bombardment
was to have started at five o’clock; but somehow
the Turks got to know about it, and our attack
was postponed till ten o’clock. At that hour we
were ready for our job.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that Saturday morning at Achi
Baba. I had my sight then, and could watch all
that was going on. We were on the ledge of our
trench, waiting to spring over and rush at the Turks.</p>

<p>Our officer was standing by us, looking at the watch
on his wrist&mdash;and a terrible strain it must have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two minutes to go!” he said. And we waited.</p>

<p>“One minute to go!” said the officer next time
he spoke.</p>

<p>Then, at ten o’clock, “Over!” he shouted. That’s
all I remember of what he said. He may have said
more, but I can’t tell. “Over!” was the order,
and over we went.</p>

<p>We all cheered, and then we went helter-skelter
for the Turks with the bayonet.</p>

<p>They were said to be two hundred and fifty yards
away, but it was a lot more than that&mdash;at any rate
it seemed so. And the ground we had to rush over
was terrible&mdash;rough and with a lot of vines about
that twined round your feet and tripped you up.
Some of our chaps were knocked flat in this way,
some fell of exhaustion, and lots were killed or
wounded. The best part of our lot were knocked
out before we ever got near the Turks.</p>

<p>But when we reached the trench that we were
going for we found that there were not many of the
Turks left. Our gunners had settled them, so that
the trench was full of dead Turks, some of them with
their heads blown completely off.</p>

<p>Our task was simple enough. We had to go for
one particular trench that was straight in front of us.</p>

<p>I can’t give any special particulars about what
happened, because it was all a sort of blur, but I
remember a few things clearly, and it’s these that I
am telling of.</p>

<p>The trench was up a hillside, and when I got to
it I saw that part of it had been blown up. I rushed
at the opening, and fell into the trench. I was
alone. I don’t know whether I was the first man in
the trench or not; but I do know that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
none of our chaps there&mdash;only myself and dead
bodies.</p>

<p>I scrambled to my feet, and the first thing I
noticed near me was a Turkish officer, wounded and
unarmed.</p>

<p>There we were, the two of us, the Turk looking at
me and me looking at him. I had my bayonet, and
I could have settled him or taken him prisoner; but
British soldiers don’t touch unarmed men, and I
was too busy to take him&mdash;and a man who is by
himself doesn’t as a rule make prisoners.</p>

<p>I was looking to see which way to go to get to our
other chaps, and the Turkish officer, noticing this,
motioned down the trench to the left to show me
where they had gone.</p>

<p>I began to clear off to them, but in my eagerness
and excitement I did not notice a wire which ran
across the top of the parapet. Before I knew what
was happening my rifle got fast in the wire at the
bayonet-standard&mdash;that is, where the bayonet fixes
on to the muzzle.</p>

<p>Then an extraordinary thing took place. My rifle
was tilted over and the bayonet stuck in the back
of a Turk who was huddled up in the bottom of the
trench. The first I saw of him was when my bayonet
struck him. I looked to see if he was dead, but he
never moved. I don’t know whether I killed him
or not, but if he wasn’t dead he was a good actor.</p>

<p>I had been about two minutes&mdash;it may have been
longer&mdash;in getting my rifle clear of the wire, and all
that time, for it seemed long, I was alone. When
I pulled myself together and went on again in the
trench I came face to face with a Turk who was
coming from the opposite direction. He seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
be mad, and made a lunge at me with his bayonet;
but it was broken and no good to him. He saw that
and turned to run away. As he did so I bayoneted
him in the back, and he fell. I could have shot
him, but my magazine was empty, for I had been
firing a lot.</p>

<p>I passed the Turk and then I found our chaps. It
seemed a good distance from where I got into the
trench to where I found them&mdash;I know I had to go
round one or two bends.</p>

<p>When we got together again&mdash;and it was a joy to
be back with my chums&mdash;we were ordered to line
the trench. I don’t know who gave the order, but it
wasn’t an officer.</p>

<p>I was the end man of the line, and we were firing
hard when a bullet came, and all I knew was that I
could not see and that I was lying on the floor of the
trench, with one of our chaps bandaging me&mdash;I
don’t know who it was.</p>

<p>I was left there while they went on firing.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long I was lying there; but I
was terribly thirsty, and drank two bottles of water&mdash;my
own and one I took from a dead man near me. I
could not see him, but I felt by groping about his
equipment that he was a British chap.</p>

<p>There were not enough of our men to hold the
trench, and they were forced to retire and leave me.</p>

<p>The Turks came up in the trench, and I heard them
shouting something like “Garrah! Garrah!” though
it may have been “Allah! Allah!”</p>

<p>They were fearfully excited, and I thought it was
all up with me then. I never gave myself any
hope.</p>

<p>The Turks were running about the trench, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
for our chaps. They ran over me, no doubt thinking
I was dead. I was lying on my side, with my
hands covering my head, holding the bandages to
stop the blood from coming out. I had to do that,
because it was only a field-dressing.</p>

<p>I knew then that I had lost my eyes.</p>

<p>I felt as if all the bones in my body were broken
with the Turks running over me and stepping on me.</p>

<p>After some time had passed the Turks settled down
a bit, not being so excited, and then they began to
search the trench and examine the bodies and men
in it. Seeing that I was not dead, they propped me
up and began searching my pockets. They were
talking away, but, of course, I could not understand
them. They were not rough just then, but they
were afterwards, when I was being led out. They
took my pay-book and photographs and everything
I had.</p>

<p>I stood up, and then the Turks took me to a
communication-trench about ten yards away.</p>

<p>As I was passing them in the firing-line they hit
out at me with their hands, trying boxing competitions
on me. They dared not have done this if
a Turkish officer had been about.</p>

<p>Two more Fusiliers were being led away along with
me. They had both been bayoneted, they told me,
after they were captured.</p>

<p>I was taken to a place where there were Turkish
doctors. One of them gave me a cup of tea. He
could speak English, and he asked me how I was.
I told him I was pretty bad. I was given a piece of
dry bread, but I could not eat it, because my teeth
were closed.</p>

<p>It was here that I met a New Zealander or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Australian, a gunner, who had been in the charge.
He had no right to be in it, but you could not keep
the Anzacs out of the scraps. He said that he and
a pal were passing through the place when they saw
what was going on. Each of them got hold of a
rifle and bayonet and rushed into the charge. The
pal was killed and the other man was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>From the doctors’ place I was taken to a sort of
dug-out, which had some kind of grass in it that felt
like heather. The two bayoneted chaps had been
taken there as well, and I was very glad to have
their company.</p>

<p>I was left in the dug-out all night, with the other
two Fusiliers alongside of me. In the morning we
were put into oxen carts, four wounded men in
each. They were rough things without springs, and
were slowly dragged over rough tracks&mdash;you could
not call them roads&mdash;so that it was fair torture to
us, bumping all the while.</p>

<p>At last we were stopped at a place and changed into
another oxen cart, and taken farther on. We stopped
again, and were given a drink out of a bucket&mdash;they
must have thought we were horses. I suppose they
must have been giving a mule a drink, and then it
struck them that they might give us a turn. But
bucket or no bucket it was a fine drink.</p>

<p>After that I went into a field hospital, and for the
first time since I had been wounded I had my eyes
properly attended to.</p>

<p>A Turkish doctor who could speak a little English
said “Eyes!” then a word that sounded like “yolk.”
I suppose he meant that my eyes were gone; but I
knew that before he did.</p>

<p>After I had been attended to I was put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
field hospital and fed three times a day. First of all
we had a ration of bread, which had to last all day,
and a drink of tea; about the middle of the day
we were given some soup, which the chaps called
“bill-posters’ paste.” It was awful stuff, and the
chaps who were badly wounded in the body could
not do with it, so they used to tipple their lot into
my basin and I would get through it, as well as
through my own. I could not eat bread or anything
else, because my jaws were affected and my
face was badly swollen&mdash;it is partly swollen still,
but I could just manage to suck the “bill-posters’
paste” through my teeth.</p>

<p>It was not until now that I really understood
what had happened to me. A bullet had struck me
on the left side of the forehead and gone clean through
both eyes, just missing the brain, and out at the right
side&mdash;a wonderful escape from instant death, as our
own doctors told me afterwards.</p>

<p>We were given cigarettes in the field hospital&mdash;a
packet of twenty on every one of the five days we
were there; and those cigarettes were a real treat.</p>

<p>At the end of the five days we had another dose
of oxen carts, and were jolted in them to the seashore,
where we were put into a steamer. They told
us in the field hospital that we were bound for Constantinople,
and I was rather glad I was going there.
I did not want to stop any longer under the everlasting
shell fire.</p>

<p>When we went on board we got a loaf of bread
and a drink of tea and a drink of water, and that
was all we had for the three days we were in the
ship. She was full, the place where I was put being
crowded with Englishmen, though there was a Turk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on a seat above me. I was lying on the floor
under it.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to get to the end of the voyage
and go ashore. I was taken off the boat, and as we
went down the gangway chaps were handing out nice
new pieces of bread, hot, and cups of tea. I was
lucky, because I had my cup filled twice.</p>

<p>I was taken into a big hall&mdash;it seemed to be a
sort of drill-hall&mdash;and was given another drink of
tea and piece of bread. Then we were taken in open
carriages, drawn by two horses, to different hospitals.
I well remember that my carriage had rubber tyres&mdash;and
that was very nice indeed after travelling in the
oxen carts.</p>

<p>I was carried on a stretcher into a hospital near
the quayside, and here I was turned into a sort of
Turk, for I was served with a pair of Turkish trousers
big enough to fit six of us. They tied round the
waist and ankles. I had a shirt also given to me, a
sort of big gown which was tied round the waist.
We looked like Julius Cæsar in them.</p>

<p>The Turks dressed my eyes and put me into a
bed, and I was glad to get in, because I had been
thrown about for ten days since I was wounded.</p>

<p>I was in this hospital for about three weeks, treated
by Turkish ladies who were acting as nurses. A
lady who was there was said to be an Egyptian
princess, the late Khedive of Egypt’s sister, and she
could speak English. She asked me my age, parents’
names, occupation and address at home, and said
that next day she would write to my mother, to tell
her how I was getting on; but when next day came
I told her that a chap in my regiment had written
home for me. She then told me a bit of joyful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
news, and that was that I was going to be sent
home.</p>

<p>There was a German Bible-reader in the hospital.
We called him Charlie, and I will say for him that
he was like a brother to us. There are good and
bad in every race, and this was one of the good
Germans. He brought two Bibles in for chaps to
read who could see.</p>

<p>At the end of the three weeks an order came for all
prisoners to go into barracks, and I was taken off in
a carriage. This time I suppose I looked a real Turk,
for I had a fez, though I had my baggy trousers
hidden by my khaki trousers, which I had put over
them, the Turkish doctor having told me to do this
to keep me warm. I scored there, because I don’t
think that the Turks meant me to walk off with the
baggy breeches. But I kept them on all right, and
I have them at home now, as a memento.</p>

<p>In these barracks we slept on a long platform, on
a sort of thick matting, which was very verminous.
At first we were fed pretty well, and then not so
well, because the Turkish food is not fit for Englishmen,
and they have only two meals a day. They
gave us rice and meat, but only a very little piece
of meat. The rice was cooked in olive oil, and it
seemed good when we were hungry, though we did
not care for it. We used to get a ration of bread
every afternoon about four o’clock. When that
time came our chaps, who were in good spirits, singing
and whistling, used to kick up a row and shout,
“Hich, Hich!” which was supposed to be Turkish,
and meant hurry up with the bread.</p>

<p>It was the Sultan’s birthday while we were in
barracks, but they did not give us anything extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on that account. The Turkish Christmas was
celebrated in August, too, but we never heard
anything about it.</p>

<p>The American Ambassador came and visited us
and gave us forty piastres each, equal to six and
eightpence. The Ambassador used to come round
to see that we were well treated, and we were always
glad to see him. Through his efforts I got released,
and was then sent into the American Hospital in
Constantinople. I was there about a week, after
which I was put in charge of two American sailors
and sent to Dedeagatch, in Bulgaria, the place that
has been bombarded lately. We stayed in a place
called the Hôtel London, supposed to be the best
hotel in the town; but the sailors said it was nothing
but an old shack. We were paying for our food and
so on, as the Ambassador had supplied us with
money for our fares and keep, and the two sailors
looked after me all the time.</p>

<p>After two or three days’ rest a train journey of a
day took us to another town called Drama, which
is in Greece; from there we went to Salonica, where
1 was handed over first to the American Consul and
then to the British Consul, who passed me on to
the military authorities. The British commander-in-chief
asked me some questions about officers who
were prisoners of war, and so on, and I told him
what I could.</p>

in the bay, the <i>Grantully Castle</i>, happy and well
looked after; then we went to Lemnos and on to
Alexandria, where I had another spell in hospital&mdash;four
days. Then it was really a case of homeward
bound, for I was put on board the <i>Ghurka</i> on
November 7, and we sailed for Southampton. On
board the <i>Ghurka</i> we had concerts and a good time
until the 19th, when we reached Southampton. I
went to St. Mark’s Military Hospital, Chelsea, then
came to this wonderful place, St. Dunstan’s Hostel,
which Mr. C. Arthur Pearson founded, and where I
am very happy and learning poultry farming.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pcn">HOW THE “FORMIDABLE” WAS LOST</p>

<p class="pch">[Just after the New Year, 1915, had broken the British
battleship <i>Formidable</i>, successor of the famous ship with
which the name of the gallant Rodney is so closely associated,
was lost while steering westward in the Channel. In the
official announcement it was stated that the cause of her loss
was either mine or torpedo, but it was not known which. Later,
however, it was stated in the House of Lords that she had
been twice torpedoed. The <i>Formidable</i> was a pre-Dreadnought
of 15,000 tons and 15,000 horse-power. In herself
she was not a serious loss; but she carried a crew of between
700 and 800 men, and of these only 201 were saved. Once
more the unconquerable spirit of British seamen was shown,
as will be seen from this story of the only survivor of his watch&mdash;William
Edward Francis, who was a stoker in the lost battleship.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I had</span> what I take to be a narrow escape of being
lost when the three cruisers were torpedoed in the
North Sea.</p>

<p>I had been called up from the Royal Naval
Reserve and drafted to the <i>Cressy</i>, which, with her
sister ships the <i>Hogue</i> and <i>Aboukir</i>, was lost; but
almost at the last moment I was transferred, with a
chum, to another ship.</p>

<p>I was spared to take a part in the victory of
Heligoland Bight; then afterwards, from a port-hole
of my own ship, the <i>Formidable</i>, I saw her sister, the
<i>Bulwark</i>, blown up, with the loss of nearly every
man on board. We were moored close to the
<i>Bulwark</i> at the time, and it was a terrible sight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
see her go like that. The Germans, however, had
nothing to do with the loss of the <i>Bulwark</i>, which
was destroyed by one of those mysterious accidents
that are bound to happen in a war like this.</p>

<p>Then, on Christmas Day, we had an amusing
experience. A German airman came and had a
look at things, including ourselves, and he hovered
over us, but bolted without even dropping a bomb.
No doubt he went back and spun a wonderful yarn
of the way in which he had thrown us into a panic,
when, as a matter of fact, we only laughed at him.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year 1914 the <i>Formidable</i>
was one of the units of a Channel squadron.</p>

<p>She was an old ship, as warships go, but there was
a lot of life left in her, especially when bad weather
had to be met, and she showed that in the Channel
on New Year’s morn, for we had run into tremendous
seas and a heavy gale of wind was blowing. On the
last day of the Old Year the <i>Formidable</i>, like the rest
of the British ships, was taking green water on
board and she was properly washed. But that was
a mere nothing&mdash;the British Navy is used to it, and
not to hiding in a canal.</p>

<p>That was the way the Old Year went out and the
New Year came in&mdash;carrying on. It was a stormy
ending to a stormy year. Night fell, but there was
moonlight, and there was nothing to be heard except
the roaring of the wind and the thudding of the seas
as the brave old <i>Formidable</i> crashed into them and
drove through them, going west.</p>

<p>Go where you will, in any part of the world, you’ll
find that Englishmen don’t let the Old Year die
without some sort of feeling and regret, and so it
happened that those of us who were not on watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
sat in our messes and talked about our homes and
those we had left behind us, and of the big things
that had taken place in the dying year. The Old
Year had truly seen some stormy times, and it was
going out in a living gale.</p>

<p>At about twenty minutes past two in the morning
I went into the stokehole. The ship was, of course,
rolling and pitching and there were plenty of big
heaves, but almost as soon as I had got below I felt
a heave which I knew could not be caused by any
ordinary roll. This heave was immediately followed
by a distinct tremble over the whole ship, a shivering
which lasted for about ten seconds.</p>

<p>A stoker who had been in one of the bunker-holds
ran out and said that water was coming in, and this
fact was at once reported to the bridge. It was
clear that something very serious had happened, but
what it was there was not any means of knowing just
then.</p>

<p>Captain Loxley, who was commanding the <i>Formidable</i>,
was on the bridge&mdash;his little dog was with
him&mdash;and as soon as he realised what had taken
place he did everything he could to try and save
his ship and her company. He issued orders calmly
and deliberately, and shouted, “Steady, men, steady!
There’s life in the old ship yet!”</p>

<p>The water-tight bulkhead doors were closed, and
a signal was flashed to the other ships of the squadron
that the <i>Formidable</i> had been struck; but, as every
one knows by this time, orders were given by the
Admiralty after the loss of the three cruisers that
when a ship has been torpedoed other ships are not
to stand by to give assistance. There was reason
to believe that the <i>Formidable</i> had been torpedoed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and accordingly the remaining ships were warned to
keep off, and they were soon lost to view in the wild
night.</p>

<p>After being struck the <i>Formidable</i> became practically
motionless, and very soon steam gave out and
she was little more than a huge rolling mass on the
heaving waters.</p>

<p>At this stage I visited the engine-room and found
that the dynamos were just giving out, which meant
that the ship would be plunged into darkness, and so
add to the difficulty and danger of the situation.
But there was nothing like panic on board. Commander
Ballard had told everybody to keep cool,
and had said that the first thing to do was to get the
boats out.</p>

<p>All hands mustered on deck and efforts were at
once made to launch the large boats, but owing to
the failure of the steam these attempts failed. The
ship had been struck on the starboard side, forward,
and by three o’clock she was listing heavily and
settling by the bows; and it was hard to keep a place
on deck.</p>

<p>It was very soon after this that a submarine was
discovered near the ship, and I need not say how
grieved and furious we were when it was realised
that it was impossible to train a single gun on the
craft.</p>

<p>After tremendous and extraordinary efforts two
boats were lowered and they pulled away into the
darkness, crowded.</p>

<p>In the meantime all the tables, chairs and things
that would float had been thrown overboard, so that
the men who found themselves in the water should
have a chance of clutching at something that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
help them to keep up, and in addition to this there
were the inflated collars which have been provided
for the crews of warships since the war began.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the submarine had vanished, but very
soon another shock was felt, this time on the port
side of the <i>Formidable</i>, so it seemed as if the craft
had gone round to make matters even.</p>

<p>“There goes another at us!” some of the men
shouted, as an explosion tore the decks and killed a
number of the survivors.</p>

<p>“The cowards!” I heard one of my pals growl;
“aren’t they satisfied at finishing us with one
shot?”</p>

<p>It was a natural enough thing to say, but war is
war&mdash;and British warships are not a canal fleet; they
keep the seas and take their chances, and don’t slink
in hiding.</p>

<p>The lights of a small vessel had been noticed about
six hundred yards away, and careful inspection left
little doubt that she was a fishing-smack. She did
not move and did not make any answer to the appeals
for help. Afterwards she slipped away and disappeared,
and I’m pretty certain that she covered
the movements of the submarine.</p>

<p>Things, however, were not by any means all bad.
Four or five miles away more lights were visible, and
these came nearer at about four o’clock, when we
found that they belonged to a light cruiser.</p>

<p>When the cruiser drew near, Captain Loxley,
thinking only of his duty, and wishful that no other
ship should share the fate of his own, signalled to
her to keep away, saying that the battleship had
been struck and that the cruiser might be struck
also; but the cruiser swept around the <i>Formidable</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in wide circles, nobly handled, and showed every
sign of being ready to lend assistance.</p>

<p>The effect of the second explosion was to restore
the battleship to something like an even keel; but
having been torpedoed on each side she naturally
sank lower and lower in the water, and it was soon
clear that she would founder. Indeed, the first
explosion was so terrible that there was little doubt
that the ship was doomed, especially in such a sea
as was then running. It was perishingly cold, with
snow and sleet, and, to make matters worse, a good
many of the ship’s company were only slightly clad.</p>

<p>Of course there was not the least intention of
abandoning the ship until it was perfectly clear that
she could not keep afloat, and every effort was made
to save her. There was hope that she might be kept
going until the day broke, and that then it might
be possible to get her into a Channel port; but she
had been too badly damaged for such a hope to be
realised and she listed terribly.</p>

<p>As the <i>Formidable</i> had been struck on each side
water was rushing in very rapidly, through huge
gaps, but the ship listed more and more. A fine
attempt was made to train the big guns on the
beam, and as these represent a very heavy weight,
no doubt some good effect would have been brought
about, but again there was not the necessary power
available, and the effort had to be given up.</p>

<p>Listing more heavily as the moments passed, the
battleship at last was almost lying on her side and
there was no hope of saving her.</p>

<p>Shortly before this had happened, and when it was
known that nothing more could be done, the survivors
mustered on the quarter-deck, and it was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
strange to see how coolly they accepted the situation&mdash;such
is discipline and the usage of war, and such
is the result of the splendid example which was set
for us by our captain and the officers.</p>

<p>The captain remained on the bridge, smoking a
cigarette, and some of the men smoked too, while
others broke into song.</p>

<p>We had our life-saving collars on, and there we
were, waiting for the moment to come when the ship
would make her last plunge.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the chaplain, with his hands
behind his back, walked up and down the deck,
encouraging the men and comforting them&mdash;and all
the time the most tremendous efforts were being
made to launch the boats. This was a task that
was both difficult and dangerous, and of four boats
that were got out one, a barge, capsized and several
men were thrown out and drowned. I might say
here that another barge managed to get away with
about seventy men, who were picked up by the
cruiser, while a pinnace, with a good number of
men, reached Lyme Regis, but that was not till
more than twenty hours had passed and a score of
men had perished through exposure. The fourth
boat, a launch, with about seventy men, was knocked
about for nearly twelve hours, then they were rescued
off Berry Head by the Brixham trawler <i>Provident</i> and
taken into Brixham.</p>

<p>But I am getting on a bit too fast&mdash;I must return
to the quarter-deck of the sinking battleship.</p>

<p>There was near me a little fellow who, a few days
before, when the <i>Formidable</i> had sailed, had said
good-bye to his mother.</p>

<p>I have six children of my own, and my heart went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
out to the lad, so I took him by the hand and told
him to carry out my instructions.</p>

<p>There was a log of wood floating near, and thinking
that this was a favourable opportunity to try and
save the youngster, I told him to jump and swim.</p>

<p>The plucky little chap obeyed, but in that heavy
sea and the bitter cold he missed his chance, and
shortly afterwards he was swept away. It was very
pitiful, but there was nothing for it but to take a
heavy risk that night.</p>

<p>I saw that there was not long to wait now until
the very end came, and so I said to a chum of mine,
who was standing near me, “Shall we jump now?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll wait,” he said.</p>

<p>I looked around, I saw that there was nothing to
be gained by waiting, and so I said, “I’m going.
Good-bye,” for by this time it was every man for
himself.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Bill,” said my chum, and there was a
grip of the hand.</p>

<p>Then I dived into the heavy icy sea and made a
struggle for it.</p>

<p>The water was bitterly cold, and in a very curious
way I suffered intense pain, because the inflated
collar prevented me from dipping my head to the
breakers and they caught me full on.</p>

<p>Very soon after I reached the water I looked back
and saw the <i>Formidable</i> disappearing. She had made
a good fight for it, and had kept afloat for a considerable
time after being struck by the first torpedo.</p>

<p>When the battleship had vanished the sea was
covered with men who were struggling for their
lives; but soon the number was lessened, because
in that bitter weather only the very strongest could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
live. One by one men disappeared, numbed and
unconscious, while others, like myself, managed to
keep afloat and alive.</p>

<p>I was encouraged by the thought that there was
a chance of salvation through the cruiser, and I
kept on swimming towards her as hard as I could.</p>

<p>For one long dreadful hour I was in that icy sea,
battling all the time, until I got up to the cruiser
and managed to make them hear my shouts.</p>

<p>Lines were thrown overboard in the hope that
survivors like myself could catch hold of them, and
I managed to seize one of these and to hang on to
it with the energy of despair until I was drawn up
near enough to be gripped by some of the cruiser’s
people&mdash;and once they got a grip of us they didn’t
let go.</p>

<p>I was hauled up on to the cruiser’s deck, and a
good many of my companions were also rescued by
her, so that with the survivors she carried to port
and the men who were rescued by the trawler, and in
other ways, a round two hundred of the crew of the
<i>Formidable</i> were saved. The rest perished.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the loss of life would have
been far greater if it had not been for the skill and
bravery of some Brixham fishermen. There happened
to be in the Channel that night, not far from
the spot where the battleship sank, a little Brixham
smack called the <i>Provident</i>, manned by her skipper,
William Pillar, and three hands.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> She was under
storm canvas, and was doing her best to seek shelter
when the battleship’s cutter was seen. The cutter
was riding to a sea anchor and was in great peril,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
while the survivors who were in the little vessel were
suffering terribly through exposure.</p>

<p>No sooner did the smack see the cutter than an
effort was made to save the men; but in such a sea
and at night it was the hardest thing imaginable to
undertake a rescue, and it was not until more than
two hours had passed and the smack had been
handled as only a smacksman can handle such a
craft, that a line was made fast between the cutter
and the smack and the men were got on board, after
a long struggle. They were all transferred to the
<i>Provident</i> by about one o’clock in the afternoon of
New Year’s Day, and they were landed at Brixham,
where they were most generously treated, and clothes
and drink and food were given to them. At other
places on the coast of the Channel other survivors
were landed, and very soon we were able to leave
for our homes for a little spell of rest.</p>

<p>It is well to remember the very fine life-saving
work that was done by fishermen when the <i>Formidable</i>
was lost, just as it was done by fishermen in the
North Sea when the three cruisers were torpedoed.
In their life-saving work at the loss of the <i>Formidable</i>,
deep-sea fishermen added one more to the many
splendid things they have done for the Navy since
the war began.</p>

<p>One result of the failure of the steam was that
the wireless could not be worked, so that not much
could be done with the sending out of calls; but
there was the Morse to fall back on, and so into the
night the lamp signals were flashed, warning the
other ships of what had happened and telling them
to keep clear. They had to obey, having no option
in the matter, and it must have been hard for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to leave the old ship to her fate, though I daresay
they were comforted by the knowledge that her
company were sure to meet their end like good
Englishmen.</p>

<p>The Morse signals were understood by the other
warships, but it seems that there were one or two
other fishing vessels about which would most surely
have given help if they had realised what had
happened and had understood the nature of the
signals. The <i>Provident</i> was packed, having only a
very small cabin and her hold and fish-room, but
once on board of her the survivors were safe, though
as far as room and comfort went, we who were
saved by the cruiser were a good deal better off.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell on the finish of the battleship,
and the terrible hour or so I spent in the icy
cold of the Channel seas in the very heart of winter.
The disaster was so sudden and tremendous that it
had a numbing effect on you, and many a poor
fellow died through exposure, either in the water or
in the boats, which were constantly swept by the
freezing seas, so that there was little difference
between being in the boats and in the water.</p>

<p>Captain Loxley went down with his ship, you
might almost say as a matter of course, his first and
last thought being for the safety of his people. Many
of the officers went with him, and as for those who
were saved, they were all, except one or two who had
been ordered to the boats to take charge of them,
rescued from the seas into which they had plunged
or had been thrown to take their chance just like
the men.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pcn">A TROOPER’S TALE</p>

<p class="pch">[It has been said that in this war cavalry have ceased to
exist. As mounted men their opportunities have undoubtedly
been very limited; but in other ways they have done much
to maintain their ancient reputation. In the earlier days of
the fierce attempt of the Germans to break through the Allied
Armies and get to Calais the teller of this tale&mdash;Trooper Notley,
of the 5th Dragoon Guards&mdash;was engaged and was finally
wounded and invalided home.]</p>


<p class="pn"><span class="beg">There</span> are a good many men who, like myself, were
at Mons, the Marne and the Aisne, and then went
into the Fight for the Coast, and I think they would
all tell the same story&mdash;that that tremendous battle
was fifty times worse than the Aisne.</p>

<p>The Aisne was very bad; but even there, though
the Germans fought desperately to prevent themselves
from being driven back and turned away from
Paris, their efforts were not to be compared with the
determination they showed in their attacks upon the
troops who barred their way to Calais.</p>

<p>The Germans were mad in their resolve to hack
their way through to Paris; but they were madder
to break through and get to the coast, so that they
could get within sight of hated England. They tried
all they knew; even as I talk they are trying as hard
as ever, but I’m as sure that they won’t succeed as
I am that to-morrow will come.</p>

<p>People have heard and read a lot about the fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
at Ypres and Messines, and it is of this part of the
battle that I am going to talk, because it was at
these places that the 5th Dragoon Guards shared in
a great deal of furious fighting.</p>

<p>We had had a long inning at the Aisne, then our
brigade moved on to the Ypres region, which we
reached after being fourteen days in the saddle. We
made a short break at Amiens, where it was thought
that we might have to help the French; but before
long reinforcements arrived for them and we went
on our road to the north, approaching Ypres as the
advanced guard of a brigade.</p>

<p>It had been hard going on the march, and there
was plenty of excitement with it, even before we got
into the real fight for the coast. There were prowling
Uhlans everywhere, and nothing would have pleased
us better than to get at them in a thundering charge;
but they didn’t give us the chance, they are not
keen on that sort of thing, and kept in scattered
bodies. But at one point quite a little surprise had
been prepared for us by about three hundred Uhlans.</p>

<p>We were marching along when we discovered that
these Uhlans had taken up a position commanding
a road, and they had planted a Maxim, so that they
could give us a warm welcome. They soon discovered
that we were not going to be caught napping. Instead
of keeping to the road we were promptly ordered to
leave it and to take to a field running alongside. We
made for the Uhlans as fast as we could go, but
they did not stop to finish the welcome; they vanished,
and I was unable to see the end of them; but it seems
that they were completely surrounded and gathered
in by some of our infantry.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="f172" id="f172">f172</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the sort of small affair that was constantly
happening, but it was a trifle compared with the real
big fighting around Ypres. The cannonade was
terrific, and the everlasting firing made it seem as
though nothing existed on earth but the thundering
of big guns and the screeching and bursting of shells
all around.</p>

<p>In and around Ypres, the Allies had pushed far
into the enemy’s line, and the Germans were concentrating
all their men and metal to crumple us up.
They strained every nerve and made the most dreadful
sacrifices to carry out the Kaiser’s command to
break through; but though they hurled themselves
to certain death, in thousands, they were driven
back.</p>

<p>Messines, a village quite near to Ypres, came
within the zone of this furious attack, and it was
at Messines that most of the brigade, including my
own squadron, was posted.</p>

<p>When we got to the village, which we reached by
way of the fields&mdash;rough going, but safer than the
roads&mdash;my squadron was ordered to hold the place
by the main road, and another squadron went about
nine hundred yards up the road and spent the night
in digging trenches, which were occupied by the
whole regiment on the following morning.</p>

<p>As we moved into the trenches we were under
incessant fire, and we were fired on all the time we
were in them.</p>

<p>For twelve days and twelve nights we held fast
to our trenches, against the onslaughts of forces that
were certainly five times as great as our own&mdash;and,
in spite of their countless losses, the proportion of
the Germans was never less than that.</p>

<p>We seemed to have nothing but shell fire and night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
attacks, and to get anything like decent rest under
such conditions was impossible.</p>

<p>There was a curious sameness in this life in the
trenches. We had no chance, as we had at the
Aisne, of digging ourselves in, because the lie of the
land was against us. At the Aisne our positions
were very strong and we could afford to smile at the
efforts of the Germans to dig us out; but it was a
very different matter in country which is as flat as
a floor. There was nothing impregnable in our
little artificial gullies, and in this absence of help
from Nature we had to keep our wits about us to
escape the shrapnel and to prevent the nightly visits
of our German neighbours.</p>

<p>We were a mixed lot at Messines. Our line consisted
of the Connaught Rangers, the Somersets,
Bengal Lancers and some Ghurkas&mdash;a mere handful
compared with the hosts of Germans that were flung
against us, with an enormous number of guns. The
more troops they sent the more we shot.</p>

<p>Day after day this fighting went on, the German
attacks getting fiercer every day. Nightfall was the
time when they would make particularly stubborn
attempts to drive us out. They would leave their
own trenches and advance two or three hundred
yards at a time, then throw themselves flat on the
ground before beginning the next stage. We had
them under observation all the time, but did not
let a sound reach them; in fact, we lured them on
by seeming not to be there.</p>

<p>On they came, till they were something like fifty
yards away, then we got the order for rapid fire, and
let drive into the ranks that it was not possible to
miss. In this manner great numbers of Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
were destroyed; we punished them terribly, for our
rapid fire was certain destruction for their front
ranks.</p>

<p>It is not always clear to people, I find, that trenches
may be constructed according to the needs of the
moment, at all sorts of odd corners and angles.
The idea seemed to be that the Germans dug themselves
in along a perfectly straight line, while we
dug ourselves in along a parallel line a few hundred
yards away. In our position by Messines the trenches
were splayed out, so to speak, some of them making
an angle of ninety degrees or so with each other.
We were so entrenched that we were inviting the
Germans to step into a hollow square, or rather to
form the fourth side of it, which with their heaps of
dead and wounded they occasionally did. Of course
the positions varied from hour to hour, both in
guarding against attempts to enfilade us and in
avoiding cross-fire between units of our own forces.</p>

<p>One night a supreme effort was made by the
Germans. The Indians had relieved us that very
morning, and one troop of our men had got into a
barn and cut loopholes in the walls, while another
troop had taken up a position at a barricade made up
of old wagons and sacks of earth.</p>

<p>At about three o’clock in the morning we suddenly
heard the sound of a bugle, and presently the Germans
set up a hullabaloo and fairly hurled themselves at
our trenches. They came in such strong numbers
that the Indians, who had been dealing out death
half the night, were overweighted by the enemy, who
got round their flank and attacked them in the rear.</p>

<p>A Maxim gun section of the 11th Hussars was
hurried down, and from the window of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
buildings it blazed away at the Germans and covered
the retirement of the Indians. The way in which the
Maxims have been handled in the war has been a
revelation to a lot of people. These handy weapons
have been got into upstairs and downstairs rooms and
even into the tops of trees, and they have caused
terrific havoc in the Germans’ solid ranks.</p>

<p>That night affair was desperate; but it seemed as
if nothing could stop the mad onrush of the Germans,
and at last there was nothing for it but to give way,
and so we received orders to evacuate the barn.</p>

<p>Near this particular point the road forks, and a
couple of men were left to fire up the right-hand
road and two to fire up the road on the left, and
for the time being we were effectually covered.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that there arose the chance
for a Territorial regiment to come into action for
the first time. The Territorials to win this great
distinction were the London Scottish.</p>

<p>The Scottish had been ordered up to relieve the
pressure, and they came on quickly and in gallant
style and took up a position at one end of the barn,
while the Highland Light Infantry, the brave old
71st, took up a position at the other, and between
them the two carried the barn with a bayonet charge
and killed, captured or drove away the Germans.</p>

<p>The Scottish had their baptism of blood in proper
good style, with a very strange preparation in the
shape of a cunning German trick.</p>

<p>Not far from the Scottish was a windmill which
had had three of its sails blown away or destroyed,
leaving only the fourth sail, and that looked as if
it had been cut clean in half. It was noticed that
this crippled sail was working about in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
astonishing fashion, and those who saw it were
puzzled to account for the movements; but it was
soon discovered that there was a German spy hidden
in the mill, and that he was moving the sail to indicate
the position of the Scottish, and so bring the German
gun-fire to bear on them. When the dodge had been
discovered and the signaller settled the Scottish got
their own back.</p>

<p>By this time I was blazing away from a barricade
in an old covered yard, and there was a straggling
fire going on all around; but it was clear that we
should want reinforcements if we were to hold our
own and save Messines.</p>

<p>At last we heard shouts, and I cannot tell you
what it meant to us when we knew that the shouts
came from our own fellows, and that three battalions
of infantry had hurried up and got into action and
given the Germans more than they could comfortably
carry.</p>

<p>It was at this moment of the saving of Messines
that I was struck by a shrapnel bullet and had to
leave the fighting-line and come home, with the fight
for the coast going on. I had been in it right from
the start and had got used to the awful business,
even to the “coal-boxes,” which the Germans were
everlastingly firing. They made a particular target
of the church, and for nine days bombarded it before
they set the building on fire.</p>

<p>One of the strangest things about a shell is that
you never know what it is going to do, and some of
the “coal-boxes” acted like freaks.</p>

<p>During this bombardment of the church I watched
one of the shells come, and expected that it would
do something smashing, for it hit the building full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in the middle of one of the main walls. I looked for
the wall to be shattered, but the shell never shifted
a brick or a bit of mortar; it simply burst in on
itself, so to speak, and did no damage to anything
except itself, and in the end the Germans got a fire
going by sending a much smaller shell, something
like a fifteen-pounder.</p>

<p>In a general way of speaking, however, these
“coal-boxes” did some terrible mischief when they
really exploded, and no living thing within their
reach had a chance of escaping. Horses, guns, men,
wagons, everything that came within the area of
explosions was shattered or wiped out. Often enough
men who were killed by the explosions were found
in the holes, so that the shell which had destroyed
them had also scooped out their grave.</p>

<p>There were all sorts of side issues to the actual
fighting. We billeted in every kind of building, some
of them very strange; but I think the strangest of
all was a cow-house. This does not sound promising;
but that cow-house was one of the finest places I
ever slept in.</p>

<p>The farm itself was beautiful, and everything about
it was on the latest and best scale, so that the cow-house
was lighted by electricity, and the fittings were
in keeping with the illumination. I had a very
comfortable stretch there, and it would not have
been possible for us to be better looked after. The
proprietor had had notice of our coming and had
made every preparation for us, and we were only
too grateful for the many good things he freely gave
away. We had the same sort of kindness shown to
us by the French wherever we came into contact
with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>It may seem somewhat odd that a cavalryman in
talking of the war should dwell so much on the
trench work and the shell-fire; but in this war a
great deal of the work of the cavalry has been dismounted,
and practically the same as the infantry,
and there has not been the chance that every cavalryman
longs for to get to close grips with the enemy’s
mounted forces.</p>

<p>We had heard so much about the Uhlans that we
expected to have some stirring times with them; but
these big encounters did not come off, and one great
thing we learned about the Uhlans was their skill
in avoiding us. We saw them everywhere, but in
scattered bodies, and they never gave us a chance
of getting at them in the mass. Whenever we formed
up in anything like force they melted away; but
one fine day we had better luck&mdash;we came across
them when they were in fair numbers, and before
they could perform their vanishing trick we had got
at them. At the end we found that we had punished
them pretty heavily, for we broke up seven hundred
lances which we had captured from them.</p>

<p class="pcn">A DIARIST UNDER FIRE</p>

<p class="pch">[There is a peculiar interest in any record of experiences
which is made while they are being undergone. Imperfect
and incomplete though they may be, yet they are of special
value because of their reliability. This is particularly the
case with some of the diaries which have been kept while

a one form this story. The author is Private Charles Hills,
2nd Battalion Australian Infantry. His share in the operations

<p class="pr4 reduct">Lemnos, <i>May 3rd</i>, 1915.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">We</span> arrived at Lemnos on the evening of the 1st of May.
The place itself is, so far as we can see, just a small
island, amongst a lot of other islands, and is evidently
a meeting-place for a heterogeneous collection of
shipping&mdash;cruisers, colliers and cattle-boats. Trading,
trawling and touting seem to be the several
achievements of this mass. We are lying just
inside ... the entrance of the harbour. All night the
searchlights play across. Quite a little storm was
caused by a small torpedo-boat “arresting” a collier
with two shots from her biggest gun. Effective argument
it proved. It seems she had not got her sailing
papers in order. The defect was remedied.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 4th.</i></p>

<p>Turned terribly cold last night. Sent us all below
to fetch our overcoats. Some of the wounded are
telling us terrible tales of maltreatment by Turks of
prisoners they take. Evidently we are up against
a lot of barbarians. We heard from the front two
days ago that the Australians’ heavy losses were
entirely due to the fact that they charged full speed
for a mile and were not content with that, but they
must needs go and chase the Turks for five miles.
Here they found the position untenable and had to
retreat. During this retreat the Turks poured an
enfilading fire into them and caused such heavy
losses. The Tommy Terriers got just as far and
without the enormous loss of life. Some of our fellows
who left us at Abbasia suffered amongst the rest: one
was killed and several injured more or less. No
doubt their example should be to our profit.</p>

Wales. At present steering S.S.W., 6 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">8 a.m., <i>May 6th</i>.</p>

<p>Our move proved to be a very short one, and ended
abruptly at about 10 p.m. As soon as we arrived we
could hear distinctly the rolling of the guns, and
sometimes see the flash of the shells bursting. When
morning came we were better able to see where we had
got to. The first thing I noticed was the cold. It
was “some.” The next was the number of boats.
Besides our own we counted seventy-six, warships
included. On looking round we seemed to be in the
Dardanelles itself, but a visit to the map disproved
this theory. It seems to me as though we are in the
Gulf of Saros, and the narrow spit of land forming the
left bank of the Dardanelles was on our right front.
Over this, it seemed that the reports were from the
guns of warships lying in the Dardanelles itself,
bombarding the forts and answering the Turkish
artillery in the hills.</p>

<p>We can plainly see the movements of the troops on
the hills in front of us with the naked eye, although
the distance must be some miles. The air is very
clear....</p>

<p>The warships look positively wicked as they glide
through the water. There are quite a number of
them here. One came up quite close to us this
morning. We could see the paint of the guns, no
doubt used to disguise them and bewilder any aircraft
that may be hovering about over them....</p>

<p>The war is amongst us in real earnest. To-day we
have been treated to what must be one of the most
striking sights to imagine. Upwards of a dozen
warships have been bombarding the coast-line. It
seems as though we were just outside the range of the
enemy’s guns, and through it being such a bright day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
we are able to see everything, and to watch the
marking of the naval gunners and the effect of their
shots. Over fifty transports are above the line of fire,
and we are to land under the guns of the battleships.
Things are just beginning to get exciting. Long rows
of lights are visible. I can only conclude that that
is the enemy’s rifle-fire.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 7th.</i></p>

<p>Well, we have arrived and landed, and contrary
to expectations we have marched straight into the
trenches. The Turks gave us a great reception, and
shelled even the boats we were landing in.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">11 p.m., <i>May 8th.</i></p>

<p>We are now drafted to our respective battalions.
Have spent our first day in the trenches. There was
quite a gathering of the clans when we joined up, and
many old mates were overjoyed to see their friends
unhurt. Since morning we have been treated to a
consistent dispute of artillery and perpetually shelled
with shrapnel and lyddite. The shrapnel is an
awfully destructive projectile.</p>

<p>The Turks seem to be filling up their shells with
any old rubbish&mdash;screws, nails, and even old bolts
came in a shell. The worst of it is the occasional
sniper in the surrounding bush. He has several
scores to his credit. We have one good shot looking
for him, and if he only gets a look at him he’ll have
to close his account quickly. The battalion has been
very severely handled, and has lost, roughly speaking,
about half its strength. Officers have suffered far
heavier in proportion to their men, a brigadier,
colonel, two majors and sundry smaller fry have been
put out of mess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>I can go no further, as my head is fairly splitting
with the noise of shrapnel, lyddite, and the continual
lying down doggo in a dug-out.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">3 p.m., <i>Sunday.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately Turks don’t observe the Sabbath,
and to-day has been as busy as any other day. To
add to my splitting headache last night, I had
scarcely any sleep at all for the third night in succession&mdash;and
the first night in the trenches, with one
hour out of three on the look-out. The consequence
is a man feels thoroughly washed out. The Turks
made one rush against us last night at about 2 a.m.,
and our boys had all to stand up with fully loaded
rifles and bayonets fixed. After a few sharp rounds
of rapid fire, however, they thought better of it, and
retired and sniped the rest of the night.</p>

<p>The strain of your first watch was more intense
than I thought anything could be, and had me fairly
mazed for a time. However, I improved and finished
up fairly well. This morning, after breakfast, Captain
Linklater came along and detailed me for observation
work at the right hand of Lewis. Armed with
a periscope, I stationed myself at one of the observation-places,
and became a target for all the snipers
in the Turkish army, I thought. The place was well
sandbagged and quite bullet-proof from front and
flank, and so I enjoyed a thorough survey of the
surrounding country and benefited much thereby....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">8 a.m., <i>May 10th.</i></p>

<p>This morning we have another job in digging a
small circular pit ten feet in diameter, to accommodate
about four men.... The lieutenant in charge says
it is for a guard-room....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Barring a little more confidence and a little more
dirt personally the position is unchanged. I am
certainly not as nervous as I was at the beginning,
although I have not been in a charge yet.</p>

<p>We’ve had two Indian Mountain Batteries join
us, and a great acquisition they are, too. Mule-drawn,
they negotiate these hills as easily as the others
do the open roads, and they are more accustomed to
warfare than the Australian boys are. The Turks
won’t reply to them at all....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">4 p.m., <i>May 11th.</i></p>

<p>Our position is unchanged, as far as I can make
out.... Our much-promised “rest” consisted of
navvying a roadway for the artillery, to get one of
their big guns up a hill in position....</p>

<p>The weather has been terrible&mdash;a real English
October day; squally thundershowers and as cold
as a March wind, added to which I caught a severe
chill last night, and you will see that I am not as
happy as I could be. I have no doubt there are some
worse off than I, but this is a chronicle of my experiences.
Despite the fact that I am wearing heavy
khaki flannel tunic, and worsted sweater, and flannel
shirt, and another heavy overcoat, I am continually
in a shiver. I am anxiously awaiting further symptoms
to decide whether it is my old friend pneumonia
turned up again. The food (iron rations), corned
beef and biscuits and tea, and sometimes a little jam,
is not conducive to mirth-producing. In the event
of it being pneumonia I suppose it is hospital for me.
Several have gone back already with it....</p>

<p>The exploding bullets are largely being used, and
in consequence the wounds are much more serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
One of our poor chaps got shot through with one of
them, which must have exploded as it reached him.
Fifteen pieces of lead were found in his head. Quite
dead, of course.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">2 p.m., <i>May 12th.</i></p>

<p>We have spent a quiet morning, after a rotten night.
Sent out at 5 p.m. to dig and shape a trench for an
artillery pit. We started off all right and presently
it began to rain&mdash;quite an easy rain, but so wet and
cold. We had no blankets with us, and at 10 p.m.
there came a halt for sandbags to be fetched. On
applying to the artillery officer in charge he considered
they were in too dangerous a position to be fetched
just then, so we camped in the rain, with no protection
other than our overcoats. We waited and waited.
No bags came along, and so we slept until four....</p>

<p>This morning we got orders to lie close, as the
battery and battleships were going to do a bit of
shelling in conjunction. My cold is not changing
much, and the cold of last night would not tend to
improve matters at all....</p>

<p>We heard a great cheering on the landing-stage
this morning. Two battalions of Tommies and the
3rd Brigade, 6000 or so, all told, reinforcing our boys.
Probably we shall get more sleep now. I have not
washed since last Thursday, six days now not shaven.
Some of them have not washed for a fortnight. If you
get down to the beach you are under shot and shell
the same as anywhere else, so you have a dry rub.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 13th.</i></p>

<p>To-day we are back in the trenches in a different
space. The Lieutenant-Colonel had us out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
inspected us in full equipment. He complimented
us on our fine showing, and also told us that the 2nd
Brigade had distinguished itself down the coast for this
sortie. The news came from him that Sydney had
had high holiday over the display of their men. One
town, Armidale, the home of Colonel Braund, had collected
£365 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the benefit of the battalion
when we arrived at a decent permanent camp. Saw
many of the old boys to-day, and looking well at that.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 14th.</i></p>

<p>One of our corporals had a remarkable escape from
a shrapnel this morning. He and another man were
sitting outside the orderly-room awaiting the result
of a conference, and they both saw the shell coming.
Private Beech moved out of the way, and the corporal
turned over and got out of the way just in the nick
of time. The shell touched his pants and tore them&mdash;another
few inches and he would have been blown
to pieces....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 15th.</i></p>

<p>Quite a quiet night and comparatively still. Had
an encouraging sight. About a mile or so away we
could see our warships shelling flying troops&mdash;and a
large body of them, too. Mr. Lowe, our P.C., informed
us that it was the main body of the Turks
retreating before the allied French, English, and
Australian troops. We could see them with the
naked eye from one of our shelter-trenches on the
hills.</p>

<p>The warships’ gunnery was marvellously accurate,
and shell after shell fell in the ranks of the enemy.
There is a large estimated loss amongst the Turks....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the Turkish officers from a neighbouring
fort having disagreed with some German superiors,
was to have been shot at dawn. In the night he
escaped and gave himself up to the Australians
here....</p>

<p>The view here is magnificent, but to be appreciated
one has to risk one’s neck and get up at four o’clock,
when things are quiet and only a few snipers about....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 16th.</i></p>

<p>The facts and results of the Light Horsemen’s
charge came out this morning. It seems that somewhere
over one hundred went out against the machine-gun
on our left front. It seems ridiculous to send out
a hundred men on a charge against an enemy well
entrenched. Anyway, they got the gun, and lost
seventeen killed and sixty or so wounded and missing.
It was a victory, as a general result, but costly.</p>

<p>To-day our platoon commander, Lieutenant Lowe,
arrived with the telegraphic compliments showered
on us by our enthusiastic population. They could
not have cheered so hard if they had been as dry as
we were.</p>

<p>Water is so scarce that we are allowed only one
pint every twenty-four hours. Out of that we have
to wash, shave, and provide the means of assuaging
a bully-beef thirst. The consequence is I have had
about one wash in about two fingers of water since
I landed, just ten days ago....</p>

<p>Our sniping friends have suffered severely, one
man, a kangaroo shooter, catching four, three of
them in half an hour. They fetch him along the line
now when they happen to spot one.</p>

<p>The tinstuff is getting monotonous, and I have
broken a tooth on those infernal biscuits. Apart
from that we have not had much to complain about.</p>

<p>The weather is getting hot in the day and not quite
so cool at night, and ever so much more comfortable.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 18th.</i></p>

<p>Snakes have made their appearance, though they
are small and nervous compared with the Australian
specimen. Water is horrible, but, thank God, the
weather is cooler, except just at midday, and does
not entail a great thirst. Our rations make up for
that. Boiled bacon has been added to the menu
and is somewhat salt, and that, added to the dryness
of our biscuit, and your ration of one pint per day,
is &mdash;&mdash; small. In the tucker respect we are much
better off than our opponents, who seem to be ill fed,
ill clad, and, as usual, ill paid.... The drawback is
washing....</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 19th.</i></p>

<p>Official reports to hand announce that Gallipoli
is in ruins, owing to a very severe bombardment from
the guns of <i>Lizzie</i> and a few of her ilk. There is
absolutely no room for argument about <i>Lizzie</i> being
effective. She is a whole army and navy in herself.
At the outbreak of hostilities here the authorities were
much troubled by the enemy having an armoured
train armed with heavy guns, and of course extremely
mobile. After it had done much damage
<i>Lizzie</i> got her eye on it, and three shots put paid to
its account. Their gunnery is little short of marvellous.
The boys here are astounded because she puts
her shells right over the strip of land we are on, and
drops them on some unsuspecting vessel in the Narrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
seven or eight miles away. To get the line of fire
and sight it is necessary to use aircraft. We have
the great Samson himself here, squinting in the air
for us, and are splendidly served in this respect. The
Turks gave him a great reception last night, and
every piece of gunnery was turned in his direction.
Fortunately he was unhurt, being miles off range.</p>

<p>I drew my first issue of tobacco and cigarettes
to-day&mdash;two packets of cigarettes and 2oz. of tobacco
and a box of <i>fifteen</i> matches! Very welcome to a
smoker, and I have no doubt they will secure many
blessings in the future....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 20th.</i></p>

<p>Contrary to expectation the Turks came again,
and in large lumps, too. They gave us a perfect
fusillade at tea-time last night&mdash;rifles, machine-guns,
and artillery kept it up till dark. Then we being in
the second line of defence (or supports), went to bed.
About twelve o’clock Wednesday they started again,
accompanied by bombs and machine-guns and rifles.
They fairly lighted the night up, and as for row&mdash;Bedlam
let loose was not in it.</p>

<p>The bombs gave us a bad moment or two. They
did not kill any one, but threw up such clouds of
dust that we were literally blinded; and then the
main attack started at about 2 a.m. on the right and
developed all along the row of trenches. A lull
occurred till about 3 a.m.</p>

<p>We stood to arms, and then it really began.</p>

<p>First they chanted their war-cry and called on
Allah and blew on a little tin trumpet. It sounded
terribly weird at that time of the morning&mdash;it was
pitch dark. We could only stand at our loopholes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and strain our eyes to peer into nothingness. Firing
continued in a desultory manner. All of a sudden
their front wing was in the first line of trenches,
which were about eighty yards in front of ours.</p>

<p>Half blinded by the dust and choked by the gas,
the boys stuck to it like Britons, and sometimes staved
the Turks off. Three Turks did manage to get in
B Company’s line, but they did not manage to get
out again. By this time we had got our bearings,
and then the boys settled down to steady firing.
Never heard such a noise. I was strained to the
utmost pitch of excitement. Times again they
managed to get up to the earthworks, but failed to
get into the line.</p>

<p>The German officers hooted them on and beat
them with their swords; but after the terrible hail
of shot one could not be surprised at their jibbing.
Two or three officers were shot, with their hard
black helmets, proving beyond doubt their nationality....</p>

<p>Last night was a mixture of prayers and curses.
Some of the boys yell for Turks to come on&mdash;they
had some “back at work” shot for them.</p>

<p class="p2">The action was continued all day. Casualties
were few, owing to excellent cover....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">5 a.m., <i>May 21st</i>.</p>

<p>All night long we were waiting for them to come
again, but the lesson had been too severe. All day
yesterday they sniped and got a few, amongst them
our special shot.... I have got the knack of keeping
awake all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>They have landed some 6-inch howitzers from the
naval boats, and these are manned by marines.
Firing lyddite, and manned by experts, they gave
the Turks the time of their lives. The Turkish
artillery is outclassed by them. Their big guns on
the forts by the shore have a moving platform and
consequently were hard to find; however, the boats
got wind of where they were, and they started to
shell our fellows last night at dusk. The tars saw
their flash and fired three shells. Have heard
nothing of them since, so suppose they hit something....</p>

<p>Last night passed away uneventfully. Just a
little rain of bullets now and then. Also the enemy
fired a new kind of shell, believed to be melinite,
which stifles a man to death and does not hit one at
all. Nice respectable death, after the manner of
some deaths!</p>

<p>A rain set in early this morning and brought
attendant miseries with it, mud and dampness and
general cussedness of every one concerned.</p>

<p>The beggars had the cheek to come over yesterday
and demand that we surrendered. After such a
pommelling as we gave them two days ago this is
colossal. I think they just wanted to spy out a bit
more of the defences.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Sunday, May 23rd.</i></p>

<p>There is a furious bombardment going on out in
the harbour. The warships are all standing in close
and tackling the last of the main Turkish forts and
strongholds in the Dardanelles....</p>

<p>Quite a minor excitement was caused by the arrival
of some submarines, supposed to be the pair that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
slipped by Gibraltar some days ago. The fact that first
drew our attention to them was the small or mosquito
craft which were running all round in circles, and the
bigger vessels were all on the move. Nothing was
heard as to whether they were captured or sighted
again. I suppose the idea was to keep a good look
out and also to provide a much more difficult mark
than if they were standing still.</p>

<p>I had a night’s sleep last night, the first undisturbed
since we landed sixteen days ago. I feel splendid this
morning, Sunday&mdash;not much like our usual one,
though. I absolutely pine for St. John’s, Wagga
Wagga, for their singing and for one hour of Canon
Joe Pike. Tommy Thornber is with me in this
respect. The most profitable hours of my life were
undoubtedly spent there....</p>

<p>The Turks around us are very quiet to-day. It
is Sunday, so they ought to be.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Empire Day, May 24th.</i></p>

<p>Peculiar thing&mdash;the long-expected armistice arrived
to-day, instead of yesterday.... I, being of
fair size, was one of the assorted few who were to
form the burial party. We set out at 8 a.m., and
started carting the Turks to their own lines and
handing them over to their friends. To attempt to
describe the condition of the bodies, some of them
having lain out in the sun for twelve or fourteen days,
some of them since they landed a month ago, would be
futile....</p>

<p>A line of flags was drawn equidistant from both
lines, and each party of men kept between their line
and the centre line of flags. As this line of flags was
made up by one Turk and one Australian alternatively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
we had a good view of live Turks. In point of physique
they are not our superiors, as I imagined, but of a
stock top-heavy&mdash;all-chest-and-no-legs sort of build;
dark almost to blackness, with such a variety of
casts of feature that they cannot be said to possess a
distinctive one.</p>

<p>The officers are undoubtedly German&mdash;that is, the
principal; and a scowling, evil-looking lot they are,
though some of them attempted to ingratiate themselves
with our boys by offering cigarettes and so on.
The body-carting finished about one o’clock, and
such work as exchanging ... equipment has been
going on.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 25th.</i></p>

<p>The submarine that was reported three days ago
got in her work on the <i>Triumph</i> this morning at
about 12.30, and she sank in seven minutes. The
loss has thrown quite a gloom over the trenches here
in camp. Our boys could see the survivors struggling
in the water and saw the old ship sink, and could
not raise a hand to help them in their trouble. As a
loss to the Navy it was not a big one, as she was one
of the older class of vessel, and from what I can gather
we did not lose many of the crew....</p>

<p>I snatched about an hour’s sleep this morning, or
I should have seen the disaster to the <i>Triumph</i>....</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 26th.</i></p>

<p>The number of men lost was only fifteen in the sinking
of the warship yesterday.... Our socks are stuck
to our feet, and the blend of the smell of our socks,
chloride of lime, and dead Turks is a subject for a
connoisseur....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>May 27th.</i></p>

<p>To-day we have had our welcome spell. Never
before did men stretch out to enjoy sleep in such
circumstances. Our resting trenches are about half
a mile away from the firing-line, and the only danger
is from spent bullets, whizzing by too high to hit the
trenches, and just beginning to drop as they get to us.
After the first line that is easy.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pcn">A STRETCHER-BEARER AT LOOS</p>

<p class="pch">[Continuing the Allied advance in France, the British forces
on September 25th, 1915, captured the western outskirts of
Hulloch and the village of Loos, and secured an advantage
near Hooge. At the same time the French took Souchez
and the rest of the region known as the “Labyrinth,” and
broke through the German line in Champagne. The fighting
at this period was exceptionally severe, and was acknowledged
by the bestowal of many honours, amongst them the award
of the Distinguished Conduct Medal to Private Harold
Edwards, 1st Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment, whose
story this is. In the official description of the award to Private
Edwards, “for conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty,” it
was stated that “he gave a fine exhibition of the highest
courage and disregard of personal danger.”]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">It</span> was at a place called Hulloch that we battled it
out&mdash;but it was Loos, all the same. All my fighting
and what I saw of it was done in the Loos district.
Our division was at Fromelles, Aubers, Givenchy and
Festubert, and a lot of minor events, and I came
through these engagements very luckily. Our first
battle, however, was Neuve Chapelle, though we did
not do any actual fighting there. We were in reserve;
but from what I learned later this was worse than the
fighting-line, because we seemed to get all the shell
fire. It was not till the battle of Loos came along
that I was unlucky and got “clicked.”</p>

<p>I wanted to be a soldier, and the very day we declared
war on Germany I enlisted in the South Staffordshire
Regiment, the old 38th. I was trained hard
for a few months; but that was easy work, because
I had been employed in a Staffordshire forge. Then,
before the Christmas of 1914 I was sent to France, and
got a spell of trench work until March, when, on the
10th, the British captured Neuve Chapelle.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not easy to say what stands out most clearly
in my mind of those early operations, because what
I chiefly remember is Loos; but I know that we were
terribly troubled in the trenches and round about
them by rats. These horrible things swarmed&mdash;they
breed like rabbits, or worse&mdash;and they went for
anything that was going. They were huge, fierce
brutes, and I know of more than one case of a sentry
on a lonely post who in the night-time got a bad scare
because he thought the Germans were on him, when
as a matter of fact it was nothing worse than an
enormous rat which was out foraging and made a
jump at his face.</p>

<p>More than six months passed between the battle of
Neuve Chapelle and the battle of Loos. Of course
an ordinary soldier doesn’t know much of what is
happening, and he doesn’t pretend to&mdash;he has his
own business to mind; but we knew for several days
ahead that something was coming off, judging by the
amount of stuff that went up. What do I mean
by stuff? Well, the shells, principally. They were
preparing the way, and were smashing up the whole
of the countryside. It was really terrible to see
what havoc was done by the German shells at
Vermelles&mdash;streets were blown to bits, churches and
houses were just made into rubbish heaps, and as
for men, especially Germans, they didn’t count. It
isn’t easy to make anybody understand what happened;
but perhaps the easiest way is to imagine your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
own house and street and the country near it turned
from a smiling, prosperous place into a heap of
dreary and desolate ruins.</p>

<p>In that battle of Loos we were thrown up against
all the latest and most devilish tricks of German warfare,
including gas. There was poison-gas and smoke-gas,
terrible artillery, awful rifle-fire, and of course
the rifle and bayonet. You seemed to be up against
every sort of devilry, including the Germans. I suppose
you can’t expect anything else from them, being
what they are.</p>

<p>We were in reserve trenches on September 24th, and
on the night of that same day we went up to the firing-line.</p>

<p>It was a miserable night, with drizzling rain all the
time. We started at ten o’clock, creeping and crawling
through a long communication trench. We did
not finish this advance job till two o’clock next
morning, and then we sat in the trench and waited
for the dawn to break. It was a solemn business,
squatting there in the cold drizzle, talking in low
tones, and wondering which of us would go down.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morn that broke, and glad we were
to see it. Then, at about a quarter past five, the
band began to play. And what a time it was, to be
sure! It was a terrible bombardment, with the
whole countryside shaking and shivering with the
crashing of the guns, and your head felt like bursting
with the din.</p>

<p>We had to stand this horrible racket for some time.
I don’t know how long, but it seemed a fair stretch;
then the word came to mount the parapet of the
trench. It was a high parapet, and ladders were
needed to get over it. There were plenty of ladders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to each parapet, and as the order was one man to a
ladder, no time was lost in getting out of the trench
and on to the open ground over which the advance
was made to the German trenches.</p>

<p>As soon as the men who were making the attack
got over the parapet, the stretcher-bearers went
after them with the stretchers. My chum with my
stretcher was Private Pymm.</p>

<p>The men of our battalion had their smoke-helmets
on, and they looked like devils. And that was a
proper thing to look, for they went straight into a
hellish fire&mdash;no other word will describe the storm of
shells and bullets that met them. It seemed impossible
for any one to live in it, yet our men went forward,
and being a stretcher-bearer I had a wonderful
view of them.</p>

<p>As soon as we got over the parapet the men began
to fall, and we began to bandage them up. What we
had to deal with were mostly “blighty” wounds, as
we called them&mdash;just one through the thigh, or a
flesh wound. We did the best we could for them;
and we had soon tackled a few. Then we went on
and tackled a few more. We had dropped our
stretcher and were hurrying about, each of us doing
the best he could.</p>

<p>I had got about ten yards ahead of Pymm, when I
heard him shout; but there was such a terrible
commotion that I could not make out what he said.
We were at that time on the open ground, and it
was bad to hear the cries of the poor fellows who
were shouting for stretcher-bearers. I was that
busy I forgot about Pymm, and supposed that he,
like myself, was dressing and bandaging.</p>

<p>People at home in England, with things going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
pretty much as usual in spite of the war, don’t realise
what cries for help from the wounded mean; but they
are very terrible and pitiful, and I shall never forget
them. But there is one fine thing about it&mdash;you
never think of yourself, and the idea of danger doesn’t
bother you, especially when you’re in the thick of it.</p>

<p>At this time the attack on the German trenches
was very fierce, and there was a tremendous fire which
seemed to sweep everything and everywhere. There
did not seem to be a chance of escaping, and sure
enough I got caught. I was hit, and I felt it; but
I did not know how I was wounded, and I didn’t
care about it&mdash;I was too full of what was happening.
And the wounded were crying for help; so I
carried on.</p>

<p>I let myself gaze at the sights in front of me. I
don’t suppose that I gazed for more than a few
seconds; but a lot took place in that short space of
time, especially where I was.</p>

<p>I was not more than forty or fifty yards away
from some barbed wire entanglements in front of
me. These had not been properly cleared away, so
it meant that our chaps had to rush them as best
they could on their way to the German trenches.
The wire-cutters dashed up and cut away at the
stuff, and the other chaps rushed on with the bayonet.
This seemed to me to go on for just a few seconds;
but I may be wrong. At any rate, even in that
short time, a terrible lot of chaps went down. I
did not notice what the wire-cutters really did;
but they must have used their wire-cutters well.
At any rate, our chaps got through and made the
Germans run.</p>

<p>Well, I watched all this for a bit, then I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the cries again, and all I thought about then was to
try and do something for the poor chaps who were
wounded and were so much worse off than I was.</p>

<p>One of our men had gone down, and I hurried up
to him and dressed and bandaged him as best I
could. He ought to have gone to the dressing-station,
but instead of that he rejoined his regiment
and kept in the fighting-line for four days more;
then, as he wasn’t fit to do any active duty, he was
sent away. I learned afterwards that this was
Company-Sergeant-Major L. Ford, of my battalion,
who has got the D.C.M.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>While I was busy on this job, several men offered
to help me and to attend to my own wound; but I
told them that I could manage all right, and wasn’t
in need of doctoring.</p>

<p>I was in full view of the Germans, but I didn’t
bother my head about that. I saw, lying in the open,
a soldier who was wounded and wanted help, and I
started off for him. I walked&mdash;I don’t remember that
I dodged or ducked much, because I wasn’t caring.
I remember that one of my officers shouted to me
to hurry up and get out of it and seek some sort of
cover. I shouted back that I was all right and that
I didn’t mind it. The funny thing is, that officers
were so anxious about their men, and never seemed to
give a thought to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>I never reached the wounded man, for as I was
staggering across the open towards him&mdash;I was beginning
to feel the effects of my wound&mdash;I felt a sharp
pain somewhere, and I gradually sank down to the
ground and lay there. I did not know at the time
what sort of a wound it was, or where; but I knew
that it was a bullet, and that I had got a second good
’un which had nearly put me to sleep.</p>

<p>A black cloud seemed to come over me and I went
into sweet slumber. I must have slept a long time,
for when I awoke I could see only a few soldiers
knocking about; but I could hear them still fighting
it out. I can’t tell what exactly took place behind
the mine which was called Tower Bridge or at the
quarries, because I was wounded before I reached
the German line. What I am talking about relates
to the things that happened on the open ground
around me when I was wounded, and what I saw in
my own neighbourhood at other times. You can’t
do more than that.</p>

<p>I had a few hours’ sleep; then two soldiers came
along and I awoke. I asked them to stick me up
on my props and give me a lift; but they were
wounded, too. However, they did the best they
could, and put me up, and I staggered about six
yards. Then I fell again, and I remember no more
until I heard a fellow shouting, “Here’s Edwards,
sergeant!” Then somebody said, “Yes&mdash;and poor
Pymm’s lower down here.” They were our own
stretcher-bearers.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, I knew that Pymm had
fallen. He had gone down, mortally wounded, when
I heard him shout. When I learned this it was well
on into the afternoon, eight or ten hours after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
fight began; and all that time I had had nothing to
drink.</p>

<p>There were plenty of the trench ladders lying
about, and one of these was got, and I was put on
it by my chums and carried to a trench at the back,
to the medical officer. Water was either not obtainable
or they would not give it to me&mdash;I dare say that
was it, because later I had empyema&mdash;so the medical
officer gave me an acid drop; and I made the best
of it.</p>

<p>When I reached the trench it started to rain, and
I got soaked, for the soil was chalk stuff and the
water could not get through. So I had to lie in the
water for some hours, and it was not until next
morning that I got to the first-aid dressing-station.
I was two days more before I got down to the
Canadian Hospital, where, afterwards, the medical
officer, Captain Parnis, who had been kindness itself
to me, told me that I had been recommended for
the D.C.M.</p>

<p>By this time I knew that I had been shot through
the lungs, and that the wound was dangerous. It
was a very narrow squeak; but a miss is as good
as a mile, though in my case it meant a long spell
in hospital. But everything that it was possible to
do for us was done, and outside people also are very
kind; they write to you and come and see you, and
they send you things&mdash;sometimes tracts, which you
don’t want. My picture was given in the papers
and kind things were written about me, and the
idea got about that I was a mere youngster. I dare
say that was the reason why some children sent me
a Christmas-box&mdash;thinking, perhaps, that I was their
own age. They sent me half a dozen cigars&mdash;real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
cigars; a little wooden horse, and a “platter” dog,
as we call that sort of crockery in Staffordshire, filled
with chocolates. I valued the children’s gift all the
more because I <i>am</i> young&mdash;just out of my teens; I
was in them when I enlisted&mdash;so I have a lot in my
favour, and hope soon to be quite well again.</p>

<p>Here’s a letter from one of the officers of my regiment&mdash;he
wrote to my dad, too&mdash;saying how proud
they are because I’ve got the D.C.M.</p>

<p>Well, I do feel proud, too, naturally; but it came
as a great surprise to me, for never did I think of
such a thing; and when people speak to me about
it, I simply say, “I only did my duty, as others
have done.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pcn">A FUSILIER IN FRANCE</p>

<p class="pch">[The following story of a baptism of fire and subsequent experiences
at Loos and in France is told by Private Fred. Knott,
who, soon after the war broke out, left civil life at the call of duty
and enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers. Like so many present-day
soldiers Private Knott kept a record, under fire, of many of his
experiences, until he was wounded and invalided home. From
this selection we become more intimately acquainted with the
life of our men not only in the trenches but also, which is equally
interesting, with their doings when they are resting and able to
share in the foreign life around them. We have had abundant
proof during the war of the considerable powers of observation
and description which so many of our fighting men possess.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">A year’s</span> hard training had got us more or less used
to marching; yet when we got to Bethune we were
nearly all done up, for we had been on the road three
days. We eagerly sought our billets, which in my
own case happened to be an attic in an empty house.
Our “cookers” followed us, so that next morning
we had a good breakfast; then we raided the pump
at the back of the house, hurried through a wash
and sallied into the street, where we saw a sight
that will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>There was an almost continuous procession of
ambulances, full of wounded men from the Loos
front; and an endless stream of men of all regiments
were walking down the street to the dressing-station.
The British soldier has a happy knack of looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the bright side of a gloomy picture, and even now
amusement was caused by the spectacle of one or
two Scotsmen wearing Prussian Guards’ helmets and
walking along quite unconcerned about their wounds,
most of which were in the arm.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we left our billet for the trenches.
At the first halt a party of 200 German prisoners
passed us. I have never seen such a collection of
dejected, worn-out individuals. One man, who was
apparently a non-commissioned officer, leaned on
the arm of one of the guards for support, and his
face was the picture of despair and misery.</p>

<p>Knowing what this war means to France especially,
and what the French have had to endure from
Germany for over forty years, it was very interesting
to notice the attitude of quite little French children
towards the captives. These boys and girls, standing
on the pavement, insulted and spat upon the
Germans, who, however, took little notice of them.</p>

<p>On the road we passed some of our own Tommies,
coming from the trenches, and rejoicing in their
relief. They wanted to cheer us, and shouted,
“Hurry up, chaps; there’s plenty left for you to
do up there.” They were quite right, as we soon
discovered.</p>

<p>From Bethune we marched to the town of Vermelles,
where we had our first glimpse of the havoc
caused by the enemy’s artillery fire. The whole
place was a mass of ruins, very few houses remaining
intact. What had been a town had been smashed
by German guns to a vast mass of rubbish. It was
a melancholy sight, yet it strengthened the determination
to do our best to overcome the tyrants
who had brought about such widespread misery and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
ruin. To make the sight all the more impressive,
we distinctly heard the booming of the guns as we
marched along.</p>

<p>Another sight which filled us with silent reverence
was a graveyard on one side of the road&mdash;graveyards,
big and little, have sprung up in all sorts of unexpected
places on and near the battlefields. There were many
simple wooden crosses marking the graves of British
soldiers who had fallen earlier in the war. The sight
of these resting-places took the mind back to those
terrible days when our men fought so magnificently
against almost hopeless odds, and solemn thoughts
came, almost unbidden, to many of us as we went
on marching towards the trenches to get our baptism
of fire.</p>

<p>Outside the town another halt was made to let
some cavalry pass. We had to wait at least a quarter
of an hour for this&mdash;and a fine sight it was to watch
the passing of these mounted men, for the nature
of this war has made it quite a rare thing to see
considerable bodies of cavalry.</p>

<p>After leaving the main road and taking one or two
cross-cuttings we found ourselves in a wild, desolate
field, covered with fairly large shrubs and weeds. It
was one of the most miserable and depressing fields
imaginable, and to crown its wretchedness rain was
falling heavily and steadily and the ground was
sodden.</p>

<p>The ammunition mules were in the rear, and we
were served out with 130 rounds each. This looked
like real business, and when it was over we extended
in artillery formation, and cautiously advanced along
the field. Everything now was done as if we were
actually in the presence of the enemy, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a singular thrill and excitement amongst us and a
constant wonder of “What next?”</p>

<p>We had moved a considerable distance, when we
reached a reserve trench. We were ordered to enter
it, for obviously it would have been fatal to go any
farther by daylight.</p>

<p>In this trench we were concealed until it was dark.
We were in great discomfort owing to the rain, and
we were almost knee-deep in mud. We were not sorry
when, as evening fell, we got out of the trench and
again advanced in artillery formation; but only for
a few yards.</p>

<p>The order was now given to lie down, for the enemy
flares were going up one after the other, and it seemed
as if at any moment our presence would be made
known and a heavy fire directed on us.</p>

<p>The long marching and exposure to the bad weather
had had their effect upon us. We were sodden, and in
addition to the weight of our clothing and equipment
and ammunition we had the weight of the rain and
the mud, so you can easily understand that as we lay
flat on the ground we dropped off into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long we slept&mdash;I don’t think it
was long&mdash;but we were galvanised into wakefulness
in a second, for a shell had burst not more than
twenty yards in front of us with a terrific report, and
a shower of earth fell on us.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of my baptism of fire, and
it was the most startling awakening I ever had. It
was a stern warning, too, and we quickly retired to
another reserve trench a short distance away and
jumped pell-mell into it. There were some good
goers that night, in spite of heavy ground and heavier
equipment; but we soon recovered our composure
when we were in the trench, and laughed and made
the best of it.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>From this reserve trench we entered the main
communication trench, and here we had one of those
mysterious and unnerving experiences which have
been so often known in this tremendous war. Progress
at the best was slow and difficult, but it was
made far worse because of the repeated issue of the
order, “Retire!”</p>

<p>For some time we kept going “about turn,” up
and down the trench, though when word was passed
down the line all our officers denied having made use
of the term, and they urged us forward.</p>

<p>This strange matter gave us something to talk
about for a long time, and the general feeling was
that it was the work of a German spy, though the
mysterious agent was never discovered.</p>

<p>We were now getting really into the thick of things,
and two companies of the battalion made their way
into the firing-line, while my own company went
into reserve; and there we had our first touch of
gas, though luckily without any serious loss of life.
When the gas attack had passed we tried to snatch
some sleep, but this was impossible, as we were
quickly detailed for various duties, such as ration-carrying
and supplying the first line with ammunition.
I found myself at the latter task, and started
out to find a regiment which was holding the front
line on the right.</p>

<p>And now I had one of those awful experiences
which have so often fallen to soldiers in this war&mdash;one
of the things which, little in themselves, mean
so much to the individual, especially to one who has
not got accustomed to such warfare as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>After making my way through countless trenches,
some of which were empty and absolutely reeked of
gas, I found myself in a narrow ditch&mdash;it could not
be called a trench&mdash;which was literally filled with
dead bodies. Snipers’ bullets were whizzing all
around me, and often I had to take cover by lying
alongside a dead comrade. Each side of the ditch
was strewn with bodies, the wounds on which were
too ghastly to be described. Thoroughly sickened
at the sight, I had to press on, treading on poor
fellows’ bodies all the time. It was truly horrible,
but the ammunition had to be got there, and this
was the only way to get along.</p>

<p>At last I reached the regiment I wanted, and found
that it was keeping up rapid rifle fire. Leaving the
ammunition with an officer, I started on my homeward
journey, which I thankfully accomplished, but
with great difficulty. I was very much impressed
by the flares as I went along, and I do not exaggerate
at all when I say that they were distinctly reminiscent
of a firework display.</p>

<p>Reaching my own lines, I found that I was not
wanted for any more fatigues, so I thankfully crept
into a dug-out at the rear and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Early next morning we attacked the enemy, and
I got my proper baptism of fire. Two of our companies
had gone into action and had lost rather
heavily, and my company was ordered to reinforce.</p>

<p>I was amongst the men who were chosen to reinforce,
and leaving the reserve trench we passed into the fire
trench and so over the top, amid a shower of bullets.</p>

<p>The Germans were hidden in a coal-mine near the
famous “Tower Bridge,” and it seemed hopeless to
try and dislodge them; but the British had determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to have a try, and so we advanced, dropping
now and again for cover. Here again the ground
was strewn with bodies, and often it was necessary
to use one of them as a covering screen.</p>

<p>It became necessary for some of us, myself amongst
them, to withdraw to the original fire trench, and
there we remained for two days. On the second day
a lull in the fighting occurred, though there was a
sharp watch on both sides and rounds were exchanged.
A strange thing happened at this stage of the
fighting. One of our N.C.O.s, going through a
deserted fire-bay, found a man in khaki who was
behaving in a very mysterious way. The N.C.O.
grew suspicious, and with the help of two privates
he marched the man before the colonel. The man
said he was a Welsh Fusilier, but one of our men
who had previously served in the Welsh Fusiliers
soon showed that the statement was utterly false.</p>

<p>The man was searched, and then the amazing
discovery was made that he had no fewer than a
dozen identification-discs of different regiments.</p>

<p>Further questionings showed beyond all doubt that
he was a very bold and cunning spy, and he was shot
with very little ceremony.</p>

<p>Another day passed, and at night we were relieved.
When we marched back through Vermelles we were
utterly exhausted, and I dare say we looked pitiful
objects, for we were thickly covered with clay and
were minus the best part of our equipment; but we
were proud, all the same, and I think the pride was
justified, for it must be remembered that many of
the men who took part in the very heavy fighting
at Loos were soldiers who, like myself, had only just
had their baptism of fire. They had at any rate done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
their best to uphold the tradition of British courage
and endurance.</p>

<p>Trench life forms such an immense feature of the
war that it will be interesting, I dare say, to give a
little detailed account of it, just to show how closely
resembling animal and savage conditions are those
which have to be endured, and which, as a rule,
are borne cheerfully and in a thorough make-the-best-of-it
spirit.</p>

<p>We had been ordered to go to the trenches, this
time on a new front. The line was situated on a canal
bank, and we took up our position at night, carefully
picking our way, helped by the lights of the flares.</p>

<p>At the end of our journey we found a series of dug-outs
at the side of the water, and I and my chum
quickly claimed one of them. This dug-out just
conveniently held two men, though space was very
limited. The prospect was not promising, but two
heads were better than one, especially on active
service, and soon we had rigged up the “mac.” sheet
and the overcoats and made a cosy bed, and we
made ourselves comfortable. We were the better
able to do this because the night was mild and the
firing confined to an occasional shell&mdash;a mere nothing
as a disturber of harmony. The next order was a
cup of <i>café au lait</i>, and I don’t think people at home
realise what a joy it is to set to work on such a little
treat as this.</p>

<p>My chum carried a small, compact spirit-lamp,
and with this and a tin mug we soon had a glorious
steaming drink ready. We dwelt on it as much
and as long as we could, then settled down to sleep,
making ourselves snug by covering the doorway of
the dug-out with a piece of old sacking. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not an easy matter, for the enemy had become
aggressive, and a heavy bombardment started. It
was bad enough to make us open our doorway and
look out, and we soon saw that the shells were finding
their mark in the canal in front of us, sending
the water up in great sprays. This we could easily
make out by means of the brilliant flares. Now and
again a shell missed fire, and we just saw it as it
plumped into the water.</p>

<p>Higher up in the officers’ dug-out a gramophone
was playing, and amid the sound of bursting shells
we heard snatches of songs that carried our minds
back to England and home. Later the shelling
ceased, and once more we tried to sleep. This time
a new trouble arose, in the shape of huge rats crawling
over us. By means of candle-light we started
destroying them with a bayonet; but this was a
difficult task, for the rats often enough were swifter
than the jabs at them. There were plenty of squeals
in the dug-out, and these and our own cries mingled
with the shrieks that came from rats outside, both
in front and rear of the trenches, which were fighting
pitched battles. This uncanny and unpleasant hunt
in the dug-out ended in time, and we managed to
gain a little rest. I am reminded that in one lot of
trenches which we occupied in another part of the
line a tree-trunk had fallen across the fire-bay, and
at night a continual procession of rats could be seen
crossing it, in spite of repeated slashes at them with
bayonets.</p>

<p>Next day we had an opportunity of scanning the
surrounding district. Farther along we could see
the damaged steeple of a church, once a handsome
building, now in ruins, for it had proved a good target<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for the German guns. On the opposite side of the
canal several fine trees had been struck down, leaving
blanks in a stately avenue. I gazed at the canal
itself and wondered how many brave fellows’ bodies
had found their last resting-place there, for it was
the scene of a big advance earlier in the year. But
my reflections were cut short by military duties, and
I was detailed for various tasks, such as rifle-cleaning,
fetching rations, etc., while my companion made a
fire to cook the breakfast. We now settled down to
a more or less regular routine, and waited our turn
to strike an offensive blow at the enemy at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>It is usual after a spell in the trenches for a regiment
to retire to a village in rear of the firing-line for a
rest, and I was always glad of this change, because
it afforded many a strange sight to me, an average
British soldier. We reached our village at about four
o’clock in the afternoon, and each platoon found itself
billeted in a barn at one of the farms which abounded
in that particular locality. Here the town-bred man
had the chance to study foreign rural life, a little hobby
which helped him for the time to forget the trenches
and their inevitable discomforts and dangers.</p>

<p>After a time we easily adapted ourselves to the
rough straw beds that were provided for us, and we
very soon found that we must not object if we had
a ferret or two in a cage quite close to the bed. As
a matter of fact we were soon on good terms with
the fierce little creatures, which have proved splendid
friends to the soldiers in the trenches in hunting and
killing the swarming rats.</p>

<p>When we went out on voyages of discovery we
found that the typical village contained one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<i>estaminets</i>&mdash;they are rarely called cafés in the rural
parts of France&mdash;and possibly one or two little
shops&mdash;<i>épiceries</i>&mdash;which sell a variety of things
appealing to a soldier’s simple tastes. At certain
hours the British Tommy is allowed in the <i>estaminets</i>,
where such drinks as beer and red and white wines
and the customary <i>café au lait</i> are obtainable cheaply.
It is found from experience that these places rarely
have change for paper money, which at times is
rather awkward, especially when combined with a
vague knowledge of the language; and the usual
reply is “No money”&mdash;truly a poor consolation to
a thirsty soldier. In time, however, we became
known to the keeper of the <i>estaminet</i>, and when
money became circulated the difficulty was remedied.
A brief stay in a village was enough to make the
villagers friendly, and little kindnesses on both sides
became a common practice.</p>

<p>A characteristic of every place was the lack of
facilities to obtain extra meals, though at certain
<i>estaminets</i> a good repast of fried eggs and chips, with
an occasional dish of stewed rabbit, was procurable.</p>

<p>This is merely a glimpse of the peaceful and gladly
welcomed break in the life of the soldier who is on
active service. It makes you all the more fit for the
trenches and that night sentry duty to which you
are so often roused in your dug-out by the corporal
shouting, “Next relief!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pcn">THE DAILY ROUND</p>

<p class="pch">[By way of contrast with the diary which was kept in Gallipoli
by an Australian soldier, and is given on page 180, and as an
admirable companion to that work, there is this diary of a young
officer, kept by him while serving on the Western Front. The
diary is of the small, leather-bound pocket variety, and it was
kept by means of the little pocket-pencil accompanying it, in
small, yet clear and coherent writing, despite shell fire, bombs
and other warlike elements. The extracts are made exactly as
they were entered from day to day, and they form a deeply interesting
record of what is “the daily round, the common task”
of a very large number of junior officers who have undergone
precisely the same experiences with unfailing cheerfulness and
courage. The writer after serving in an Officers’ Training Corps,
was posted to a Service battalion of a famous old Line regiment.]</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct"><i>Dec. 13th, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Marched to &mdash;&mdash;, seven miles. Water in places
up to the knees. No billets for B Co. on arrival.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 14th.</i></p>

<p>Marched to &mdash;&mdash;, three miles.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 15th.</i></p>

<p>Marched up to trenches, &mdash;&mdash;, eight miles. Awful
condition. Big craters in front, and three saps in
our line.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 16th.</i></p>

<p>Narrowest escape of self yet recorded. Shell burst
in trench and killed man one and a half yards away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and blew your humble into the mud, together with
another C.O. and others. Two other men wounded.
Felt a bit shaky for some time.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 17th.</i></p>

<p>Relieved for forty-eight hours and marched to
&mdash;&mdash;, four miles. Good billets. Delicious shave
and wash, and two glorious nights in my valise.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 18th.</i></p>

<p>Pass into &mdash;&mdash;, to see H.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> No luck&mdash;on leave.
He returned ten minutes after I left for &mdash;&mdash;.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 19th.</i></p>

<p>H. ran over to see me, and we had two full hours’
“jawing,” and <i>café au lait</i>. Left for same trenches
at 12.30. Had a warm reception with artillery, and
owing to some “show” in the vicinity had to stand-to
for hours. Raining hard and mud knee-deep&mdash;miserable,
and thought and thought of the happy
home, and wondered and wondered! Went out on
patrol with one man at five next morning, but had
to return post-haste, as three of the enemy were on
similar job and washed our intentions out.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 20th.</i></p>

<p>Shelling all day, both sides. Few men hit.</p>


<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 21st.</i></p>

<p>At stand-to, 6 a.m. Much shelling. Very uncomfortable.
At 7.30 an enemy mine went up&mdash;a
fearsome thing. The sensations were these&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="p1">I. A horrible rocking of the trench.</p>

<p>II. A tremendous dull roar.</p>

<p>III. A huge column of earth rising higher and
higher into the sky.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">Then came the falling matter, we lying in the
bottom of the trench, while everything imaginable
fell around&mdash;earth&mdash;huge clods&mdash;sandbags and
timber. One big piece of wood landed with a thud
a foot from my head and spattered me with mud.
Escape No. 2 since I joined. Fortunately the mine
was lifted just beyond our saps, and presumably in
the same place as the crater. No one was seriously
hurt&mdash;only two slightly knocked about. Of course
an attack was expected, but none came, and we
stood-to till 8.30. Had an awful time from mine
explosion till we were relieved at 2.30 p.m. Marvellous
how we all escaped. I thought my number was
up every minute, and my nerves were not of the
best and I was feeling a bit rocky. While relief was
being carried on we had an awful time: all kinds
of shells, big and small, landing everywhere. Very
fortunate to get out with no casualties. Incoming
regiment had a few. At 11.15 p.m. I returned to
trenches in order to go out again on patrol. Was
out for thirty minutes, took survey and returned
safely, covered with mud and pretty wet. Returned
to &mdash;&mdash; Farm, where my platoon is billeted. It is
a small fortress, built up with sandbags from a big
ruined brewery. Last night while asleep, about 3.30
a.m., a big shell burst just outside my cellar door,
and again I thought my number was up. Earth,
etc., was shot into my abode, and the doorway blocked
up, not to mention bricks; but I was left intact.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 22nd.</i></p>

<p>Shelling this ruined village &mdash;&mdash; all the morning,
and the trips to the men at meal-times were very
risky, the latter being in another keep 150 yards up
the road. One had to dash for it every time. Shelling
remained hot, so had to remain at the mess till
after tea, 4.30 p.m.</p>

<p>Gas attack from our trenches at 9 p.m. Quiet
for ten minutes, then fearful shindy. Stood-to in
our redoubt, but had to get to cellars when shelling
started&mdash;and <i>such</i> shelling: the worst I’ve ever
experienced. They came in dozens. Then we began,
and the noise was hellish. They fell all around us and
some hit the shattered walls, making a hail of bricks.</p>

<p>I felt a peculiar tightening round the heart when
one of the big variety buried itself under the cellar
wall I was in and failed to go off. It fairly seemed
to lift the floor, and the sickening thud was as bad
as the fearful racking explosions. It was nothing
short of miraculous that our cellar got off scot-free.</p>

<p>All this time we could see through our loop-hole
the explosions of the shells on the trenches, 300 yards
to the front, and by their light and the light of the
German searchlights and fires we could see the huge
clouds of gas on their death-dealing errand.</p>

<p>The Germans put huge fires on their parapets to
lift the gas over their heads.</p>

<p>It was an unforgettable scene, with their and our
own star-lights making night into day. It was
indescribable pandemonium.</p>

<p>The shelling died down after a couple of hours,
and we stood down and tried to sleep; but it started
again at 12.45 a.m. for an hour, and again at 4.45 a.m.;
and this practically meant stand-to all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the worst nights I’ve spent out here&mdash;in
fact, the worst.</p>

<p>About 2 a.m. I got word that &mdash;&mdash;, one of our
B Co. officers, was killed while waiting to go out on
patrol to ascertain the effects of gas on enemy. He
was a fine chap, and most popular, and even now it
is difficult to believe he is really gone. Another
lucky escape for us (B Co.) that we were not occupying
the trenches. They were blown out of all
recognition and the casualties were awful, the lines
being strewn with dead and wounded and buried
men.</p>

<p>The trench occupied the previous night by my
platoon is absolutely gone, and only six men are
left in the platoon holding it at the time of the
“show.”</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 23rd.</i></p>

<p>Shelling continued all the morning&mdash;most uncomfortable,
and we had many narrow escapes, walls
round us being blown to h&mdash;; but still our cellar
got off. We were relieved at 12.30, and, things being
quieter, we got off down the road at top speed.</p>

<p>What joy to see actually motor buses waiting for
us three miles back, which took us by way of &mdash;&mdash;
to &mdash;&mdash;, a small village where our few days’ rest
and incidentally Christmas, will be spent. The
change will be much appreciated by yours truly. I
have just had my first wash and shave for four days,
and feel cleaner than ever before in my life; and in
a clean change and new suit I wouldn’t call the King
my aunt!</p>

<p>A delicious surprise was the sight of H. on the
road, waiting for me as our convoy of buses neared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
&mdash;&mdash;. We had a good chat, and I hope to see
him to-morrow again.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 24th.</i></p>

<p>Morning with platoon, cleaning up, etc. Afternoon
obtained pass to go and see H. Had a glorious
Christmas Eve, far beyond expectations. Good tea,
theatre, dinner, and two hours’ solo. Fine evening.
Came back on the carrier at 10.30.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 25th.</i></p>

<p>Christmas Day in France.</p>

<p>Up at 6.30 and marched bathing party into
&mdash;&mdash;. Left them and looked up H. In bed; got
him up and had breakfast with him and a walk
round, and marched my party back here &mdash;&mdash; by
10.30. Wrote two letters and found five waiting
for me&mdash;long-delayed ones. This was a fine Christmas
gift.</p>

<p>11 a.m. Went over to men’s sports till 12.30
lunch. Helped to pay out from 2.30 p.m. till four.
Tea and chat till dinner; chicken and plum pudding.
<i>Very good.</i> Talked till 10.30 and then to bed. Very
quiet evening, during which my thoughts were for
the most part with the dear old folks at home....</p>

<p>NEXT CHRISTMAS???</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 26th.</i><br /></p>

<p>Quiet day. Morning, church parade and men
cleaned up. Afternoon, other officers out, so I was
O.C. for the time being. Spent two hours censoring
eighty letters! Quiet evening. Dinner and chat;
bed 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Heavy bombardment going on in distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 27th.</i></p>

<p>Morning, getting ready to move.</p>

<p>Moved at 2 p.m. Raining.</p>

<p>Got into trenches at 4.30 p.m. In reserve, 1500
yards from enemy&mdash;and a nice change for B Co.</p>

<p>At night I went on patrol with a man to find a
way across country to A Co., who were holding a
line to our right front. Awful going, but got there.
Came back by road through &mdash;&mdash; village and Danger
Corner. Out two and a half hours.</p>

<p>Slept as well as I could on a narrow board till
7.30 next morning.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 28th.</i></p>

<p>Quiet day. Went out at night with C.O. Got
lost, and were out three hours. Good joke.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 29th.</i></p>

<p>Quiet day. Went out in the morning on voyage
of discovery round old trenches. Went in to the
left shoulder in mud and water. Another good
joke!</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 30th.</i></p>

<p>Quiet day. A few shells on the right; but we
were left alone. At 5 p.m. I went out with a party
of seventy, carrying all kinds of things to the front
line. Out till 8 p.m. Quiet night.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Dec. 31st.</i></p>

<p>A wet day. The road behind was shelled heavily
all day, but fortunately it was quiet while we were
being relieved after dusk. Had the real Bank Holiday
feeling on getting to reserve line billets two miles away,
and enjoyed a splendid night in my valise. Had one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
drop of whisky at 9.30 p.m. to drink the health of
the New Year; but sleep was by far the most important
thing, so to bed at 10 p.m., to dream of home
and the dear old past.</p>

<p>Woke during the night to hear the guns in the
back garden booming in the New Year, and shaking
and rattling walls and windows. Dreams shattered!</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 1st, 1916.</i></p>

<p>What luck for the New Year?</p>

<p>How fervent is the hope for a glimpse of the <i>end</i>
before many of the new months have gone.</p>

<p>In the morning looked round the men and inspected
several things, followed by a little revolver practice.
Had a sleep, or tried to, after lunch; but attempt
was futile, owing to thoughts.</p>

<p>Went out with party of fifty at 5 p.m. to the
trenches, repairing roads, filling up shell-holes, etc.
Returned at 9 p.m., and to bed.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Sunday, Jan. 2nd.</i></p>

<p>Church parade in top floor of rickety old barn at
11 a.m., followed by an impromptu Communion
Service, during which my thoughts wandered....
These services always touch me more than anything
else I know of, and unbidden thoughts rise and fill
me with longings and yearnings that are inclined to
be unpatriotic, as well as bringing the familiar lump
to the throat which every one experiences out here
at times, and a queer feeling round the heart.</p>

<p>Afternoon, went to &mdash;&mdash; in company with
other officers in motor lorry, to attend lecture on
telescopic sights and sniping. Returned at 6 p.m.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and joyfully found I had just missed a working party
to the trenches.</p>

<p>Tucked myself in my valise at 9.30.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 3rd.</i></p>

<p>Platoons cleaning up. Inspected rifles, etc. Had
my first lesson in riding. Felt rather insecure at
first, but found the “bump” after an uncomfortable
100 yards jogging about, to the great delight and
amusement of my men; at which I joined in. Had
a small gallop before finish, and stuck on.</p>

<p>Afternoon, writing letters and reading, and out
with working party to the trenches at 4.30 p.m.,
mending shell-holes in roads, etc. Returned at
9 p.m., and to bed.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 4th.</i></p>

<p>Relieved and went to &mdash;&mdash; for a four days’ rest,
at 11.30 a.m. Spent afternoon in reconnoitring old
trenches in neighbourhood, to see necessary repairs
required, stores, etc. Quiet evening. Splendid billet&mdash;bedroom
to myself, feather bed and sheets, wash-stand;
very lucky for once. First bed since leaving
Boseghem four weeks ago. Good mess-room, fire
and two arm-chairs. House kept by two middle-aged
women, very kind, do anything; also little
niece, aged eight, who speaks English well. She and
I are good friends.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 5th.</i></p>

<p>Out with working party to repair trenches from
9.30 a.m. till 1.30 p.m. Lunch and letter-writing.
Went up to &mdash;&mdash; later to execute several shopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>commissions. Had splendid crop first since &mdash;&mdash;
after patiently waiting <i>one hour</i>. Oh! these
French hairdressers! One snip of the scissors every
five minutes; one requires the patience of Job.</p>

<p>Went to pictures; pretty fair; and had dinner
at the Lion d’Or. It seemed very quiet and deserted
compared to my last visit, when the M.C.s were
there. Back at 9 p.m., and to bed between the
sheets.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 6th.</i></p>

<p>Out with working party, as per yesterday, from
10 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. Lunch 2 p.m. Inspection of
B Co. by C.O. Me in command of company! Two-thirty,
paid out to the men. Awful long job.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 7th.</i></p>

<p>Morning, 10 a.m. to 1.30 p.m., out with working
party. H. called for few minutes, 2 p.m. Lecture
on arms and care of rifles, etc., 4 p.m. Met H. at
Lion d’Or in B. at 4.45 (splendid being able to do
this). Tea, long chat and theatre at six o’clock.
Panto., <i>Alladin</i>. Really tip-top, although men were
disguised as girls. Plenty of fun and laughter.
Sent in an application to-day for post as observer
in R.F.C. Have great hopes. Life consists mainly
of latter nowadays.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 8th.</i></p>

<p>Working party repairing trenches 9.30 to 1.30.
Lovely morning. Two p.m., lecture in field on use
of rifle&mdash;old as the hills (lecture); but I suppose
they must work on the motto, “Anything to keep
the time employed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Sunday, Jan. 9th.</i></p>

<p>Marched to trenches (same place as Dec. 15).
Beautiful day and everything quiet&mdash;not a day for
war at all. On nearing the line the noise of guns
and bursting shells broke on our ears, increasing in
sound as we drew nearer, until we got as per usual
in amongst them.</p>

<p>Had to go in single file at intervals up the infernal
road. No one hit.</p>

<p>Got in the same old corner, and found to our relief
the trenches had been built up again passably well
after the bombardment of the night of Dec. 22.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 10th and 11th.</i></p>

<p>Contrary to expectations had two quiet days&mdash;of
course, the usual few shells, but no great quantity.
My platoon occupied the trench on left of company,
instead of, as last time, close up on the right, 1000
yards from enemy.</p>

<p>Relieved at 8 p.m. on 11th, and we came back
to the old keep (&mdash;&mdash; Farm). Everything very
quiet all night, and enjoyed a good sleep on a stretcher
in one of the cellars, despite the attentions of rats
in plenty.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 12th.</i></p>

<p>Quiet walk up to Headquarters for breakfast and
back. Enemy began shelling roadway close by, and
everything else within reach, at 11.20; still going
on at time of writing, 12.45. When shall I be able
to go up for lunch?</p>

<p>Got there intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 13th.</i></p>

<p>Quiet day. Went back to front line at 7 p.m. for
a further forty-eight hours. Quiet night.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 14th.</i></p>

<p>Found in the morning that in addition to the
usual bombs, grenades and shells we had a trench
mortar opposite us, which kept lobbing big black
objects over all day, burying men and knocking our
trenches to pieces. There was not much else they
could use on us now; but we gave them back two
for every one we received, and at 2 p.m. we commenced
a big “strafe” with rifle-grenades, bombs
and mortars. It was good to see them bursting, and
altogether we expended over 800 (!) in an hour.</p>

<p>We got all manner of things back, from a bullet
to a 6-inch. The latter were falling 100 yards from
the rear of our breastworks, and we could actually
see them falling the last fifty feet or so.</p>

<p>All quiet by 4 p.m. Quiet night&mdash;far different to
our expectations.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 15th.</i></p>

<p>Each side shelling all day unceasingly, with the
usual quota of bombs. We were relieved at 7.30 p.m.,
and came back in safety to &mdash;&mdash;, after six more
days of LIFE?</p>

<p>Very weary, and thankful for quiet and my valise.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Sunday, Jan. 16th.</i></p>

<p>Marched to a small village&mdash;seven miles, and
found we had comfortable billets, and a mattress
for the writer. Moving again to &mdash;&mdash;, nine miles
from here, to-morrow. HURRAH! We are (or
should be) “out” for sixteen days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 17th.</i></p>

<p>Marched to &mdash;&mdash; on the famous cobble-stones
of France the whole way. Poor feet! On arriving
was delighted to find I had a cosy room with
feather bed and a good mess 200 yards down the
road. Spent the evening trying to get level with
correspondence. Hope we shall stay here all the
time. Shall spend most of my spare moments
writing&mdash;one of my chief pleasures when out,
especially now I’ve got a respectable pen!</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 18th.</i></p>

<p>Slack day. Enjoyed the luxury of a “mess” and
a fire. Spent a lot of time writing.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 19th.</i></p>

<p>My second birthday in the Army....</p>

<p>To-day’s events, musketry and rifle drill, and shooting
on a temporary range in afternoon. Lovely day&mdash;like
spring.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 20th to 28th.</i></p>

<p>Detailed for course of bombing instruction; and
between these dates I learn much concerning these
nefarious love-tokens.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Jan. 28th to Feb. 14th.</i></p>

<p>Our period of “Rest.” (Time spent out of the
trenches is so miscalled in the Army!) It was
extended for reasons known only to those in lofty
positions, and we spent the time in performing all
the evolutions of an infantry battalion in training,
drill, manœuvres, etc. Of course, all this is very
necessary after the sometimes enforced inactivity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the trenches, and helps to pull out the kinks; but
it gets rather monotonous, and when we heard that
we were off to the line again every one was glad.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Feb. 15th.</i></p>

<p>Said good-bye to our friends of the village and
headed once more for the Land of Thrills. It took
us three days, doing it in easy stages.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1"><i>Feb. 18th.</i></p>

<p>Found ourselves in cellars in a much-ruined village
just behind the line, viz. &mdash;&mdash;. There were exciting
events last night, before our arrival, a few
enemy mines having gone “up,” and as soon as we
arrived we had to begin fatiguing, connecting up the
craters with the front line.</p>

<p>(At this point the diary abruptly finishes; but the
writer was kept busy from day to day in the routine
manner, doing his turn in each line, with the usual
“hate” progressing, but nothing of great importance
happening. Long exposure to the severe weather
sent him into hospital, thence home, invalided. The
very day after he reported “nothing of great importance
happening” many of his comrades fell in a
gallant and desperate assault on the Hohenzollern
Redoubt.)</p>

<p class="pcn">SAVING THE SOLDIER: DR. GRENFELL’S EXPERIENCE</p>

<p class="pch">[Leaving his great work in Labrador and Newfoundland, so
that he might visit the front as a member of the Harvard
Surgical Unit, Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell spent three months in
France as an army surgeon, and during a short stay in London
related some of his experiences and indicated the marvellous
advance that has been made in over-coming disease and saving
our soldiers’ lives. Not long ago in public, Field-Marshal Lord
Grenfell said that when he and Dr. Grenfell went into large
communities people did not say to Dr. Grenfell “Are you
a cousin of Lord Grenfell?” They said to him (Lord Grenfell)
“Are you a cousin of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell?” And he was very
proud indeed to be able to say yes. Dr. Grenfell’s two cousins,
the twin brothers who were both captains in the 9th (Queen’s
Royal) Lancers, were killed in action, one of them, Capt. F. O.
Grenfell, being the first of the recipients of the Victoria Cross
granted for the present war. Two other cousins, the brothers
Capt. the Hon. Julian Grenfell and Sec.-Lt. the Hon. G. W.
Grenfell, sons of Lord Desborough, have also fallen in the war.]</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="beg">I am</span> on my way from France to Labrador, and I am
really sorry to be out of khaki, though I never was
in it before.</p>

<p>While I was in the thick of my work on the other
side of the Atlantic I was invited to join the Harvard
Surgical Unit at the front. I found it possible to
do so, because I knew that in my temporary absence
my work in Labrador and Newfoundland would be
faithfully carried on by my friends and devoted
helpers. So I came over and was attached to the
Harvard Unit with the rank of major, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
experiences I have gained as an Army surgeon will
remain amongst the greatest and proudest of my
life.</p>

<p>I have had the opportunity of seeing what the
British Army is doing in many ways in this terrible
war. I have been at many places, including the
base at Boulogne, and many great battle-centres,
such as Ypres, Bethune and Armentières. And I
have been in the trenches, so that I have had full
chances of seeing what is really going on. It is
hard, almost impossible, to find words in which to
express admiration of the courage, endurance and
humanity of the British troops in this terrible
conflict.</p>

<p>All my life has been a roving one, ever since I
took my degree as a doctor exactly thirty years ago.
When I really began life I decided to look for some
field of work where I could be useful. I went into
the London Hospital, and very soon became intensely
interested in the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea
Fishermen. In those days the fishing vessels were
all sail, and when a man was seriously injured he
had to be transferred to some vessel that was carrying
fish to Billingsgate, and then he was taken to
the London Hospital. This state of things on the
North Sea brought home to one the possibility of
Christian men preaching the gospel of love and
help; and men went out and largely brought about
that wonderful revolution which we see to-day
amongst North Sea fishermen.</p>

<p>I cannot help feeling that in the trenches, right
along the line where the surgical men are working,
there is just the same problem to deal with as we
encountered in those early days of mission effort in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the trawling fleets. Very great difficulties had to be
overcome in performing operations in tiny mission
hospital smacks on the open sea far from land; just
as unusual obstacles have to be surmounted in
treating wounded fighting men at the front to-day.
The problem in the North Sea was to heal men’s
bodies, as well as to help them to take a higher view
of life; and it seems to me that the problem at the
front is just the same.</p>

<p>In dealing with the body there have been preventive
developments which are little short of marvellous.
The history of war is not the history of wounds,
as a rule it has been the history of disease; and
speaking as an unbiassed person I think that in this
connection we are doing a perfectly magnificent
work.</p>

<p>First of all, the troubles of the trench fighting have
been the gas bacillus, which is an animal bacillus,
and the tetanus bacillus. Both began operations in
this war with terrible results, but now they have
scarcely any effect.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the soil in France
and Flanders, where so much of the fighting has
taken place, is highly cultivated, and is therefore
splendid breeding-ground for these deadly bacilli.
So much is this the case with tetanus that in the
early stages of the war bits of uniform which have
been driven into the body, however slightly, were
infinitely more dangerous than serious wounds
caused by clean shrapnel, for the cloth, by contact
with the soil, had become infected with the bacillus.
I have seen men with pieces of shrapnel left in their
wounds and doing well, but a piece of uniform,
sodden with the rich soil, was a very different thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
But so wonderful has been the advance in the method
of treating tetanus that to-day, if taken in time,
such a thing as a fatal result is extremely improbable.
Every soldier is so quickly and skilfully treated
that danger practically does not exist.</p>

<p>The very terrible gas bacillus caused another very
common disease, for the gas produced a kind of
gangrene; yet now there is very little mortality
indeed from this cause.</p>

<p>In the beginning, too, any number of men were
lost from typhoid fever, but now typhoid is getting
so rare that if a case occurs anywhere on the front
it is known the same night at the French General
Headquarters. That remark applies to the whole of
our armies, and so rigid is the control which is kept
over these matters that, on the day following the
report, a searching local inquiry is held as to the
cause of the disease.</p>

<p>At the front I saw men who came from all parts
of the country where I have been working for the
past twenty-five years&mdash;Canadians, Americans, and
so on. And in passing just let me say that in connection
with this war we are misjudging America
because of the attitude which the President has
taken. I have stayed with Mr. Wilson and with
Mr. Roosevelt, and I know that the spirit of America
is with us. It is because the whole spirit of the
American people is with us that thirty-three doctors
and thirty-six nurses&mdash;most of them giving up
splendid practices&mdash;went out from America to the
front, as the Harvard Unit, to help us. Just so the
Chicago Unit, and many more Americans fighting in
the ranks.</p>

<p>I have seen at the front men of all ages and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
every rank in life&mdash;veterans who were a long way
over the army age, and immature youths of sixteen
or seventeen. The spirit of loyalty and the determination
to do their bit made them go. Often
enough a boyish patient would smile when I looked
at the chart and asked him how old he really was.
“Oh, that’s my Army age,” he would say, and go
on smiling.</p>

<p>I was right round the trenches two weeks ago, and
as that was early in March and the winter has been
exceptionally bad, the conditions were intolerable.
There is no anxiety, because everybody is sure that
the line is strong; but the wet, mud and exposure
make you think that the men will get pneumonia and
bronchitis; yet what mostly happens is trench-foot.
I have seen a lot of that in Labrador, where we call
it frost-bite. It is not, however, the same, though
it appears to be. I have travelled many times in
Labrador in winter, when the thermometer has been
twenty and thirty degrees below zero, and I have
never had frost-bite except once in my life. That
was when I was driving my dog-team over the ice.
The ice broke and my dogs went into the sea. They
shared a floe with me throughout an awful night,
and my life was saved at the sacrifice of theirs. I
have told that story in detail elsewhere, so I need
not tell it now.</p>

<p>I saw 150 men from a Highland regiment with
frost-bite, but that was quite exceptional, and was
due to the phenomenal weather and the impossibility
of relieving the men when their relief was due,
because they were fighting continuously for over
forty-eight hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another direction in which immense strides
have been made, and that is with respect to vermin.
At one time, at the beginning of the war, there were
as many as 4000 men who had scabies, or itch, and
were out of action for the time being; but you hardly
see such a case now, because of the wonderful measures
which are taken to keep the troops perfectly clean
and fit.</p>

<p>Close behind the trenches immense vats have been
placed to serve as baths for the men, and the happiest
fellows I saw were those who were rolling and splashing
in these hot baths, while their uniforms and clothing
were being thoroughly cleansed in super-heated
steam-chests and finished off with heavy hot irons.</p>

<p>Just as we got into one of these cleaning depots a
Jack Johnson burst very near us, but nobody took
the slightest notice of it, so accustomed does one
become to the happenings of war. Five or six men
were in each hot bath, and something like 2000 baths
a day are given. The men become thoroughly clean
personally, and their clothing also is perfectly freed
from vermin and filth, and the troops look as happy
as possible.</p>

<p>I was greatly struck by the coolness and courage
of all who worked in these laundries, women as well
as men, and I could not help thinking that if I stood
one week of it I should be entitled to the D.S.O.
Endless thousands of uniforms, socks and articles
of underclothing are constantly dealt with in the
manner I have described, and many of the workers
are under artillery fire all the time.</p>

<p>In the treatment of bad wounds, too, there has
been a very great advance, and for such cases as
broken femurs such an ingenious device has been
hit upon that you might well say that instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
putting a man into bed you put the bed on to the
man. The R.A.M.C. is really doing its very best,
and I shall go back to America feeling perfectly
satisfied that the British soldier is getting all the
attention that I could wish to have myself.</p>

<p>When the war began the surgeons did not know
where to put the wounded, because of the varying
fortunes of the fighting. Even Boulogne, Calais and
Havre were not certain of safety, so that attending
to the wounded and accommodating them was a
precarious thing; but the temporary hospitals have
been gradually replaced by stationary hospitals, the
mobile makeshift has been succeeded by the permanent
institution, and so splendid and complete
are our resources now that in one day the enormous
total of 100,000 casualties could be dealt with by the
R.A.M.C.</p>

<p>Casualty clearing-stations, field ambulances, advanced
dressing-posts and fixed hospitals are about
as perfect as they can be made; and so admirable
are the arrangements that I saw one man who had
been shot through the abdomen and was in hospital
in less than an hour from the time he was wounded&mdash;which
is almost quicker than you would do it in
London.</p>

<p>A great many of the less seriously sick and wounded
do not have to go to the base at all; at times one
rest-camp was sending 80 per cent, straight back to
the line, entirely new men; and, as they say in
America, it would “tickle you to death” to see how
these things are done.</p>

<p>If you count up the men who have been wounded
and invalided from all causes you will find that there
are still twice as many sick people as there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
wounded; and the strange thing is that as there
are more wounds there is less sickness, because
directly a “push” comes the men don’t think
nearly as much about sickness as when there is
nothing doing.</p>

<p>If you take 1000 persons in ordinary civil life you
will find that there will always be 3·3 sick per
1000; but at the front the rate is not quite half as
many&mdash;only 1·8 per 1000 men. It is a very strange
thing, but I have met with a number of men who
were always more or less sick in civil life, yet who
got quite well again at the front. The trenches are
the place for a change of air!</p>

<p>I am sure that after this war a very great many
men will never go back to the civil life they were
in before. They must have more life in the open
air; and there can be no finer field for them than
that glorious Canada which I know so well, with
its boundless possibilities of harvests and material
development.</p>

<p>One is impressed at the front with the apparent
valuelessness of human life, and deeply impressed by
the lavishness with which that life has been laid
down by all ranks for King and country. This
remark applies to every rank of life without exception,
to the highest of the aristocracy as well as to
the humblest private. And very remarkable, too, is
the zeal and willingness to serve in quite subordinate
positions of men who have had every advantage in
life, particularly the University type.</p>

<p>I remember at one place, when we were sitting in
the mess, a sergeant brought in a paper, which he
handed to the colonel to read. It was a most
elaborate scientific treatise on the body vermin that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
so greatly trouble our troops, and it was beautifully
illustrated. In addition to that the paper showed
the willing endurance of personal suffering for practical
purposes that I for one should not have cared
to undergo, for the sergeant had made himself
thoroughly well acquainted with the effects of the
visitation of the pests he described.</p>

<p>I was so much impressed by the performance that
I said to the colonel, “Who is your sergeant?” and
he replied, “Oh, he’s the Professor of Entomology
in the University of &mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>As I talk my mind takes me back to Labrador
and its ice-bound coast, and I recall that when
working through the ice-fields in our little mission
ship, the <i>Strathcona</i>, or travelling in lonely regions
with my dog-teams, I saw so many evidences of the
eagerness of men out there to do their bit in this
tremendous war. Almost to a man, when they
heard that we were fighting, they wanted to come
over. But at first in Labrador we got very little
news, and when news did come it was not credited.
“Oh,” said the men, “don’t you believe it. They’ve
always got some scare on. They’re going to put the
price of fish up!” Fish, you know, is the greatest
of all material things out in that vast and lonely
land. But what happened when they knew that it
was not a scare, but real war, and a fight for liberty
and justice? Why, 1500 men of Labrador and
Newfoundland went into the Navy alone, and these
brave and splendid fellows crowded into the Army
too. A thousand of them were in Gallipoli. And
wherever they were they found their hard experience
of the utmost worth. Our trappers soon learn the
knack of getting a seal with the gun, though the seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
only just pops his head through an ice-hole and the
tiny target is the hardest of all things to see. But
the trapper gets him&mdash;he seldom misses; and whenever
a German puts his head out&mdash;well, he gets
it too.</p>

<p>I have been in Labrador twenty-five years, and I
am proud of the way in which my friends out there
have done their duty at the front.</p>

<p>My own view of life is that one has to do one’s
duty in any place where one happens to be; and I
know from what I have seen that our splendid fellows
at the front have the same outlook. There are
many, many soldiers out there who, with practically
nothing to look forward to when the war is over,
are sustained by one great thing, and that is the
knowledge that they are doing their best.</p>

<p>I have mentioned Canada as a great place for
receiving men who will be set free when the war is
over. I have just seen the statement that Canada
has gone prohibition from end to end, and that
pleases me very much. I have spent thirty years
amongst deep-sea fishermen and sailors as a medical
missionary and a master mariner, and I have shared
many dangers with them in the North Sea, out on
the Labrador coast and elsewhere, but I have seen
more sorrow and misery in the homes of our seafaring
men through drink than I ever found in even
small craft at sea.</p>

<p>All these things that I have spoken of come under
the heading of practical religion and real Christianity,
and rightly so. I do not believe in the Christian
religion being negative; it is essential that you make
it positive.</p>

gallantry from September 25th to 29th, near Hulloch. Although
severely wounded on the head in the early part of the operations,
Company-Sergeant-Major Ford continued to advance and give
encouragement to his men until he fell. His example and devotion
